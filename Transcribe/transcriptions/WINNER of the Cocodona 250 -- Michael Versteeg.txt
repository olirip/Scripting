[5.71s -> 9.77s]  It's good. It's cool. And I'm almost I'm all done working for the week
[9.77s -> 13.03s]  So I got home and took a nap and took a shower and nice
[13.87s -> 17.05s]  Yeah, well, I really appreciate you doing it again, man
[17.05s -> 18.11s]  Like yeah
[18.11s -> 23.55s]  it sounded good for like the first 15 or 20 minutes and then it started sounding really bad and I was getting all this
[23.55s -> 30.03s]  feedback in my ear and I couldn't concentrate on whenever I would ask you a question like I'm hearing three second delay of my
[30.03s -> 31.91s]  own voice and
[31.91s -> 35.31s]  felt like I felt like I was being a bad interviewer and then
[36.47s -> 41.03s]  Yeah, when I when I played it back, it just sounded like pretty much like dogshit. I'm not gonna lie
[42.79s -> 49.49s]  Is it sounding better now, oh dude, it sounds fantastic. It sounds great man. Yeah, totally good
[50.79s -> 56.03s]  All right. Well for anybody listening, this is our our second shot at this
[57.15s -> 59.15s]  we let's just get all the
[59.67s -> 61.63s]  all the
[61.63s -> 65.21s]  like I said last time and like I've already
[66.63s -> 69.59s]  Preface is out of the way now and let's just let's just
[70.39s -> 74.51s]  Take it take it like we're doing it all the way. I appreciate that
[74.51s -> 81.11s]  It's gonna be a little redundant for us, but that's all right. Yeah, just when your eyes are rolling for me repeating myself
[83.55s -> 87.23s]  The listeners won't won't see that no I like it man and
[88.23s -> 89.67s]  thankfully, I
[89.67s -> 93.11s]  Like I like you, you know, you seem like a cool guy. I don't mind hanging
[93.39s -> 98.71s]  Vice-versa so that's probably why yeah if I I wouldn't be doing this again if you were
[100.43s -> 106.23s]  Hard on the eyes and the ears same way like if I was stuck with a douchebag I would have been like, yeah
[106.23s -> 109.75s]  It's good, man. Don't worry about it. Yeah, I mean, I didn't want to say that but
[113.19s -> 115.19s]  No, we got free rein here
[115.39s -> 121.91s]  That actually was gonna I forgot to ask you yesterday at the beginning like how I have an awful mouth, you know
[121.91s -> 129.55s]  So, uh, oh whatever you want it just okay. Yeah, no, please please be a hundred percent yourself and say whatever you want
[129.55s -> 133.91s]  Man, we got we can yeah anything goes. There's no rules here. So
[135.27s -> 137.27s]  Yeah, man, so
[139.07s -> 141.07s]  First and foremost congrats
[141.83s -> 147.43s]  Congratulations on coca-dona 250 man. I mean it was the inaugural year and
[147.79s -> 150.87s]  It's in your backyard your buddies with Jamil
[151.27s -> 154.99s]  So it's fitting that that you won this thing
[155.99s -> 157.99s]  just a fantastic effort and
[158.71s -> 164.51s]  You know, your name isn't huge in the ultra running world. Like when I looked you up on ultra sign up
[164.51s -> 169.71s]  You've definitely got some races under your belt. Yeah, but um, you know, we want to get to know you
[169.71s -> 173.67s]  We want to know who you are. So yeah, let's give us an intro
[173.67s -> 179.95s]  I'm definitely a pretty like nitchie athlete if you will it's like I feel like people who
[182.74s -> 188.70s]  Know me I feel like you know, like like what I do and you know, and
[189.86s -> 194.50s]  But but you're right. It's definitely like southwest running is sort of its own little
[195.38s -> 197.38s]  bubble in a lot of ways and
[198.34s -> 202.94s]  but and and and I feel like a lot of the
[203.62s -> 209.98s]  Things I've done that I'm sort of proud of in ultra running aren't necessarily on ultra sign up, you know, like I
[210.82s -> 212.06s]  don't
[212.10s -> 216.90s]  I don't take a lot of pride and like showing up and just like running random 50k
[216.90s -> 222.58s]  and you know, it's like that like I a lot a lot of the things I I take pride in are more like
[222.62s -> 224.62s]  personal projects and
[224.74s -> 226.74s]  kind of you know, I
[227.42s -> 232.90s]  Don't know just just sort of weird off-the-cuff things that don't necessarily show up on those pages
[234.50s -> 238.94s]  So whether that's like FKT's or just sort of smaller
[239.78s -> 243.62s]  Races that don't necessarily use that website and
[244.50s -> 245.94s]  so
[245.94s -> 252.46s]  But yeah, yeah, I mean you're definitely right like I'm by no means of one of these famous ultra runners that and
[253.14s -> 258.58s]  I I kind of like it that way. But even if I didn't like it that way, I wouldn't be anyways
[262.02s -> 268.26s]  Well, it's cool when somebody comes onto the scene and they win a big race and it's like well, who is this guy?
[268.26s -> 273.10s]  You know, yeah all about like how how does he train or what does he get up to and
[274.42s -> 276.42s]  Yeah, man, so
[277.22s -> 283.66s]  In your resume, it looks like the biggest thing that you've done correct me if I'm wrong was an FKT and the Arizona Trail
[284.54s -> 289.46s]  yeah, I would say so that definitely is the one thing that like I
[290.22s -> 293.02s]  remember even after I did the Arizona Trail is like
[294.10s -> 297.70s]  No, I don't take a lot of pride in many things that I do for myself
[298.30s -> 299.94s]  and I don't you know
[299.94s -> 304.86s]  But I remember after the Arizona Trail feeling I go like that was pretty fucking cool
[304.86s -> 309.50s]  Yeah, like I definitely had had some like self-pride
[310.18s -> 311.62s]  after that
[311.62s -> 317.86s]  Wasn't wasn't ashamed of it. I guess is one way of putting it to be proud of myself, you know, and
[318.50s -> 324.18s]  And that was that was a really cool thing. It was you know, when I did there is on a trail the
[325.18s -> 329.54s]  There hadn't really been a proper speed attempt yet
[329.54s -> 336.18s]  so the the record was sort of there for the taking for the first guy to like really put down a solid time and
[336.90s -> 342.76s]  So I I instead of having a record to chase, you know, which you know, everyone has that now
[342.76s -> 347.42s]  You know, you have a time so you can sort of set up your whole project in order to beat that time
[348.22s -> 353.38s]  I didn't really have that so I just had to set my own personal goals and
[355.18s -> 356.98s]  You know at by the end of it
[356.98s -> 361.50s]  I was able to accomplish those goals of going over 50 miles a day for the whole stretch and
[362.14s -> 365.02s]  even with the constant sort of disasters
[365.98s -> 367.98s]  happening I
[367.98s -> 373.46s]  Was able to sort of push through and do that, you know the last the last five days or something. I was probably doing
[374.42s -> 376.42s]  20 hour days and
[376.78s -> 378.78s]  just and that was
[379.30s -> 383.60s]  That was pretty crazy, you know that that push and I was in really rough shape
[384.18s -> 385.42s]  and
[385.42s -> 387.42s]  my legs were just
[387.94s -> 394.92s]  really torn up from all the all the catclaw and and and I was I was experiencing these like post monsoon
[395.38s -> 402.74s]  Blooms in and southern Arizona sort of separated between these sky islands these big mountain ranges and in between
[402.74s -> 409.62s]  There's these low grasslands and the grasslands were just completely overgrown with these thorns and I would go like a hundred feet
[409.62s -> 411.62s]  in my
[411.74s -> 418.46s]  Socks and shoes and just everything would just be full of hundreds of thorns and and since my legs were so torn up from all
[418.46s -> 424.54s]  the catclaw the the grasses were like getting into my bloodstream and like causing me to have like these like
[425.26s -> 431.50s]  allergic reactions and just swell my legs and my feet and so like my feet just like my feet were perfect for like
[431.50s -> 437.74s]  Ten days and then they just totally fell apart when I hit those grasses and I would like come into camp at night
[437.74s -> 443.06s]  I would have looked down and just have these like bloody pussies stumps of legs, you know
[443.06s -> 447.62s]  And I was like pounding antihistamines like as much as I could and it was just it was just wild
[447.74s -> 450.66s]  But that's like that's the Arizona Trail. So it's like
[452.14s -> 458.78s]  It's part of it gnarly even like messaging Joe string me and the guy who just broke it like like I'm
[459.42s -> 461.10s]  Right when he finished, you know
[461.10s -> 466.58s]  I like we had been talking sort of a little bit here and there when he was out there and I
[467.34s -> 473.42s]  Was giving him a huge I was trying to warn him as much as possible about snow on the North Rim and to anybody
[473.42s -> 475.66s]  who followed Joe's effort it was like
[476.78s -> 482.98s]  What I told him the week before he started I was like look the worst thing possible that can happen is is to run
[483.50s -> 489.58s]  750 miles at a record pace and then get shut down by postholing for 80 miles through the snow. Yeah, and
[490.58s -> 498.18s]  He got to the North Rim and it he actually quit one night because there was so much snow and he eventually got back
[498.18s -> 499.42s]  out there but
[499.42s -> 503.74s]  It was like the first thing I said to him when he finished was like congratulations
[503.74s -> 507.98s]  Like it's it just it wouldn't be the Arizona Trail at least one thing
[508.50s -> 513.78s]  Like didn't hit the fan, you know, so he shouldn't look at it like a lost opportunity
[513.78s -> 516.54s]  You know like one like one thing has to go awful
[517.34s -> 519.34s]  At least for like a day, you know
[520.58s -> 524.78s]  But yeah, he he killed it. Yeah, he did. He really did
[525.50s -> 531.36s]  So I'm not super familiar with the Arizona Trail. What do you do to sort of mitigate that postholing?
[531.62s -> 535.34s]  I mean, well, I know Jeff Garmire the guy who actually
[536.06s -> 538.40s]  Broke my record for the first time
[539.66s -> 545.26s]  He actually got really lucky and it was so cold at night that it froze and he was able to like
[545.50s -> 547.82s]  Run on top of it. Okay
[548.46s -> 552.82s]  but it's why spring attempts on the Arizona Trail can be so fickle because
[553.14s -> 556.90s]  It can be a hundred it can be over a hundred degrees in the desert and there can still be
[557.66s -> 559.66s]  Four feet of snow on the North Rim
[560.22s -> 564.74s]  So like if you're hiking it and you can depend on seasons changing like that's one thing
[564.74s -> 568.62s]  But if you're trying to do it in less than two weeks, like you have to pick what you want to deal with
[571.34s -> 575.10s]  That's why northbound spring attempts are so difficult
[575.42s -> 577.06s]  southbound
[577.06s -> 579.06s]  fall attempts
[579.06s -> 583.14s]  If you can get the North Rim out of the way with basically before the first storm
[583.66s -> 590.18s]  So you push as late into the season as you possibly as you want to risk it before it snows on the North Rim
[592.02s -> 597.14s]  Then you can get that out of the way with and then now you're still that's what I did now
[597.14s -> 601.50s]  I still had to deal with super hot temps down down south, but
[602.34s -> 603.94s]  In
[603.94s -> 609.50s]  My head that always made sense and that still makes more sense to me is to do fall
[611.06s -> 615.66s]  South bound attempts, but I mean all the guys who have broken all the records have done
[616.46s -> 622.82s]  Spring northbound northbound. Okay, even though I think strategy wise it makes more sense to do it the other way
[622.82s -> 628.18s]  But I also can't speak like they they did it and they figured it out. You know, yeah
[628.82s -> 635.02s]  There are a lot more water sources in the spring so that that helps that helps, you know, but
[635.50s -> 642.02s]  Yeah, so are you nice? I mean to kind of kind of to like tie this back into coca-dona. I guess
[642.94s -> 644.62s]  is like
[644.62s -> 646.62s]  You know, that was such a crazy
[646.94s -> 648.94s]  hard difficult thing for me
[649.98s -> 653.46s]  And it's like those sort of things and the little bit
[653.46s -> 659.72s]  I've talked with Maggie about her finish and her race and like she really wants to do longer stuff, you know multi-day
[660.22s -> 662.10s]  FKT stuff and like
[662.10s -> 667.70s]  Going into coca-dona and having it not be the hardest thing I've ever done is was like a huge
[669.22s -> 671.50s]  Draw for me to like a huge
[671.98s -> 676.78s]  Confidence builder for me like the whole time I was out there day two day three and I'm feeling like shit and like
[676.78s -> 679.06s]  It's like this is not that bad, you know
[679.06s -> 683.06s]  Like this is not what I had to go through on the Arizona trail. So
[684.26s -> 686.74s]  Having that experience was huge, you know
[687.78s -> 693.26s]  Yeah, it's like it's almost over like I can push hard for a few days. This isn't yeah
[693.26s -> 697.98s]  Even yeah, even at the start line like this is like the last three days of theirs on a trail
[697.98s -> 700.10s]  Oh, like I'm almost there, you know
[700.10s -> 705.38s]  Like I can go into it with that mentality like at the start line like that. I'm almost there totally
[705.38s -> 710.18s]  So it's that's that's that's a really huge advantage to be able to do that. Yeah
[711.10s -> 713.82s]  Speaking of advantages, how much does it help?
[714.74s -> 720.06s]  With this race just pretty much being in your backyard like this is like your stopping grounds you train
[720.06s -> 722.06s]  This is where you train most of the time, right?
[722.54s -> 725.78s]  Yeah, I mean I can't I cannot under like
[726.30s -> 732.02s]  Overstate that how how much of an advantage I had because I knew every aspect of course
[732.02s -> 739.90s]  I think I think besides we kind of figured it out. It's like besides maybe like Sedona proper at some point in my life
[739.94s -> 745.34s]  I've called like every region on this course like home before you know, whether it's
[746.26s -> 749.46s]  Whether it's growing up exploring mines in the Bradshaw's
[750.46s -> 752.46s]  And like growing up in Prescott
[753.46s -> 756.54s]  Through sort of like those middle school high school years
[757.58s -> 764.66s]  I used to work in Jerome and Cottonwood and Page Springs and all the Verde Valley like I used to work on the
[764.98s -> 769.50s]  Vineyards out there. So running around all those all those places and
[770.18s -> 774.14s]  Went to college in Flagstaff. I've lived in Flagstaff a couple times. I still spend
[774.94s -> 781.14s]  some of my best friends live in Flagstaff and I you know, ski up there all the time every year, it's like
[782.14s -> 787.82s]  So yeah, really besides like I've never technically lived in Sedona, but it's still like even Sedona
[787.82s -> 793.14s]  You know, like I go climbing in Sedona like, you know once a month or something. It's like I'm there all the time
[793.14s -> 795.14s]  it's like
[795.82s -> 797.82s]  So, yeah, I mean that
[797.82s -> 802.42s]  Besides just the comfort that that brings a person when it's like
[803.34s -> 804.86s]  the third night
[804.86s -> 810.22s]  it's the middle of the night and you're in the middle of fucking nowhere and like you're exhausted and you're
[810.62s -> 814.34s]  Hallucinating like just the comfort that it brings to like know where you are
[815.06s -> 818.30s]  like that's that's psychologically like really big and
[819.10s -> 822.90s]  but also just like literal advantages like
[823.02s -> 824.22s]  Like
[824.22s -> 825.26s]  Like
[825.26s -> 831.62s]  Let's take like Mike McKnight like where he ended up dropping like that's one of the hottest most exposed parts of the course
[831.62s -> 834.06s]  And that's why I slept right there
[834.50s -> 841.54s]  Okay, I got there like one in the afternoon and it was my intent to sleep during the hottest part of the day and not
[841.54s -> 843.98s]  Hit that section at the hottest part of the day
[844.34s -> 849.78s]  Because I know that trail Jamil and I scouted that trail years ago trying to figure out a good way to get from
[849.78s -> 852.62s]  Jerome to Cottonwood and it's like
[853.98s -> 856.10s]  Or Jerome to Sedona. Sorry, but
[858.18s -> 860.18s]  Like and
[860.82s -> 865.42s]  It's not just that I know the trails, but I know how hot they are. I know the terrain
[865.42s -> 870.74s]  I know if there's cover or not, like I know everything about every foot of that race and like
[871.86s -> 875.06s]  You know Mike probably again. I don't want to
[875.66s -> 878.66s]  Speak for Mike or know what was going on in his head
[878.66s -> 883.86s]  but I imagine he probably saw that as an opportunity to put some distance between us and
[884.86s -> 888.54s]  He got baked, you know, it's like and like
[890.38s -> 892.74s]  So, I mean that's it's I
[893.62s -> 896.38s]  Can't overstate it. I mean the advantages were huge
[896.38s -> 900.70s]  You know, I think it's why myself and Peter came in first and second, you know
[900.86s -> 905.98s]  And Peter's the same way like he lives in Flagstaff and he knows all those sections of trail and
[906.46s -> 909.06s]  It's like it's actually funny at one point in the race
[911.18s -> 913.66s]  My pacer James and and
[914.50s -> 916.50s]  Pete's pacer MJ
[916.78s -> 920.58s]  Like we were all out on the course at the same time and like a month ago
[920.58s -> 927.14s]  The four of us were on like a 20-mile run together in Sedona, you know, like getting ready for coca-dona
[927.14s -> 930.46s]  It's like so yeah, I can't I can't over again
[930.46s -> 936.86s]  I know I'm repeating myself now, but I really can't overstate the advantages. I had just and just the the
[937.82s -> 944.06s]  like the adrenaline and endorphin boosts that I get from like when I run into downtown Prescott like
[944.58s -> 950.18s]  This is my home, you know, I live in Prescott again now like so not only did I grow up here
[950.18s -> 954.46s]  But I'm living here now. I live a hundred feet from the course in the Granite Dells
[955.62s -> 957.78s]  so like to be able to
[958.78s -> 966.18s]  Run in downtown Prescott like middle of the night like run down whiskey row and like hit that aid station and see a bunch of
[966.22s -> 969.02s]  Like the guy Jonathan there the guy that gave me that like half
[969.62s -> 973.82s]  Cupful whiskey like at the eight say like I went to elementary school with him
[973.82s -> 977.78s]  Oh, wow, you know and so to be able to like draw all these
[978.58s -> 983.54s]  Endorphins off and energy off of people and that was true throughout the race
[983.54s -> 986.50s]  I mean there were people because of the live streaming the live coverage
[986.66s -> 992.98s]  there were people coming out to find me on the middle of the trail in the middle of nowhere just to like run with
[992.98s -> 996.14s]  me for like a mile or two really and it's like
[997.22s -> 1000.54s]  like all around Flagstaff and all around Prescott and
[1002.10s -> 1004.42s]  Again like to be able to I mean I
[1005.42s -> 1012.34s]  was just having this conversation earlier about like how in these long ultra marathons like you you use
[1012.54s -> 1018.24s]  anything you can possibly find as a source of motivation and like all of those things are
[1018.46s -> 1023.90s]  Huge motivators for me to like not sit on my ass on the side of the trail and like keep moving, you know
[1025.58s -> 1031.38s]  So yeah, I mean I could probably do this whole hour on the advantages I had
[1034.54s -> 1040.30s]  Were you was Mike McKnight ahead of you at one point or were you guys going back and forth?
[1040.30s -> 1043.94s]  I've had him on the podcast. I don't I don't know how well, you know him, but he's a cool guy
[1043.94s -> 1047.38s]  I like it. No, I I don't I've actually never met him. I
[1053.10s -> 1060.50s]  I think the way the rat race sort of panned out was like he took it early easy pretty early on
[1061.10s -> 1068.38s]  And then around like mile I pushed to mile 130 before I I slept
[1068.70s -> 1070.70s]  okay, and
[1071.02s -> 1074.62s]  The reason why I did that again to go back to advantages
[1074.62s -> 1079.22s]  The reason why I did that was because I wanted to get to Tuzigoot on the Verde River
[1080.58s -> 1086.06s]  Before the hottest part of the day so I could sleep through the hottest part of the day and then head out
[1086.22s -> 1089.34s]  Through Sedona and do all of Sedona at night
[1092.46s -> 1094.06s]  Again
[1094.06s -> 1097.10s]  Supers like strategic and I was able to do that
[1097.14s -> 1103.26s]  I was able to pull that off and as far as I know I I'm pretty sure the way the course went was like I
[1103.26s -> 1104.22s]  was
[1104.22s -> 1106.62s]  Sort of in the lead up until that point
[1107.46s -> 1114.18s]  Mile 130 and then I laid down to sleep for a couple hours and while I was sleeping he came through
[1114.46s -> 1118.74s]  Okay, and went out and then I think I when I woke up
[1119.78s -> 1125.26s]  I caught him a few miles down the road and he was he was in pretty rough shape at that point
[1125.90s -> 1127.34s]  and
[1127.34s -> 1132.18s]  I mean and also I was also just coming off of a sleep
[1132.18s -> 1140.86s]  Mm-hmm and was like it was cooling off and I was feeling like super good and like, you know, he's
[1141.82s -> 1143.82s]  He's in that pit
[1143.94s -> 1149.46s]  And I come running along up behind him, you know, like all cheerful and like looking good like hey guys
[1149.46s -> 1154.82s]  How's it going? You know that like we all know how that is like there's no good way to get past like that
[1154.82s -> 1157.10s]  you know, like that's pretty demoralizing and
[1157.70s -> 1162.82s]  You know you try and even like me like I know I'm gonna do that to him, right?
[1162.82s -> 1167.74s]  Like I know that I'm gonna make him feel like that and it's like there's no way I cannot make him feel like
[1168.26s -> 1171.64s]  totally, so it's like I try to be nice, you know and like
[1172.18s -> 1177.94s]  Wish him well, but like when I saw him you could tell like he was he was getting sun-stroked
[1178.66s -> 1182.30s]  And I've been I've gotten heat stroke
[1182.50s -> 1187.84s]  A couple of times in my in my day and I know how that feels and I know what it looks like and
[1187.94s -> 1189.94s]  You could see it on his face
[1190.50s -> 1192.50s]  I think that was it for him
[1193.10s -> 1199.66s]  At that point. Yeah, and again, I can't I get I don't want to get into his head and speak for him, but
[1200.50s -> 1202.50s]  it's like
[1202.50s -> 1206.88s]  The heat was brutal and if you didn't if you didn't manage it and if you did
[1207.88s -> 1211.39s]  Like
[1211.39s -> 1213.51s]  Yeah, I don't know I don't know what else to say
[1213.51s -> 1216.55s]  But a lot of people got cooked out there for sure
[1216.63s -> 1221.55s]  But again because of my strategy and how well I know the course I was able to do most of the really hot
[1221.55s -> 1227.71s]  Sections at night. Okay, so it's almost like I had the easiest go of it because I was out in front
[1230.03s -> 1233.97s]  Like I was able to do all of Sedona at night
[1234.63s -> 1236.07s]  which was
[1236.07s -> 1237.15s]  like
[1237.15s -> 1239.15s]  insane for people
[1240.31s -> 1245.47s]  So do it doing doing all of that section during the day was so hot for people
[1245.47s -> 1251.15s]  So again another advantage because I was out in front during the really hot part of the day as I was up in the trees
[1252.19s -> 1258.43s]  Or it's why my strategy was to the first 30 miles to do do like the fastest
[1259.27s -> 1262.27s]  Section of the course for me was gonna be that
[1262.83s -> 1267.79s]  Now I ended up not being the case obviously because the terrain was so crazy difficult
[1267.91s -> 1269.91s]  I think in that first
[1271.27s -> 1276.11s]  30 miles drew calculated like 9,500 feet of climbing
[1277.35s -> 1284.11s]  To get up. So it's basically like running a sky race is your first 30 miles in a 250 mile race
[1284.27s -> 1287.21s]  But also it's like 90 degrees out and exposed
[1287.71s -> 1291.03s]  So it's like that like it's it's hard. It was difficult
[1291.03s -> 1294.83s]  So like obviously it wasn't the fastest 30 miles that I did of the whole course
[1294.87s -> 1301.59s]  But I would say as far as effort went because I knew that first 30 miles is you run from the desert up into the mountains
[1301.59s -> 1302.95s]  and
[1302.95s -> 1306.27s]  So my goal was to get out of the desert as soon as I fucking could
[1306.91s -> 1311.11s]  And like don't worry about pace. Don't worry about any of that. Just get out of the desert
[1311.43s -> 1316.19s]  So I think that's one reason why I probably led so early, you know, like usually these races
[1316.79s -> 1319.83s]  There's not that one person that leads like the whole time
[1319.83s -> 1322.07s]  I think that that's like kind of a rare thing
[1322.07s -> 1327.39s]  But I think that's why that happened was because I was like so anxious to get out of the desert
[1327.39s -> 1329.39s]  Yeah, you know, yeah
[1329.39s -> 1336.23s]  How long did it take you to get to that hundred and thirty mile spot where you finally took your first nap? I
[1337.43s -> 1342.79s]  Got there at one. So what is that seven? That's eight hours. That's 32 hours
[1343.91s -> 1349.19s]  Okay. Okay. Yeah, so I did a 32 hour push. I slept for two hours and
[1351.54s -> 1353.54s]  Then I did a 20
[1353.94s -> 1361.45s]  So, what does that put me I think I left there around four in the afternoon and then I did a
[1362.21s -> 1364.29s]  like a 16 hour push
[1366.64s -> 1368.64s]  slept for an hour and
[1369.04s -> 1371.16s]  Then I just pushed into the finish from there
[1371.32s -> 1371.80s]  Okay
[1371.80s -> 1378.32s]  so about three or a couple other times that I tried to sleep where I like laid down for five minutes and
[1378.88s -> 1385.12s]  If I didn't fall asleep within five minutes, I would start to get in my head that I was wasting time as well
[1385.56s -> 1390.44s]  So I would just get up. Yeah, so there were two other times that I tried to sleep unsuccessfully
[1391.96s -> 1398.24s]  And that was that that was that when I first got into Sedona I tried that and then
[1399.12s -> 1400.36s]  at
[1400.36s -> 1403.92s]  Walnut Canyon would just like, you know 20 miles left
[1403.92s -> 1409.08s]  I thought that if I could just sleep for 10 minutes, I would be able to do that section like twice as fast
[1410.00s -> 1413.76s]  But I ended up not being able to sleep and I ended up just wasting like an hour
[1413.76s -> 1421.00s]  That was the one thing I really screwed up strategically at this race was I wasted about an hour at Walnut Canyon
[1421.44s -> 1428.44s]  But it wasn't just that I wasted that time. It was that I allowed myself and my legs to get really tight
[1428.96s -> 1436.24s]  I felt way worse when I left that aid station when I even got there and like more tired and more exhausted
[1436.24s -> 1441.12s]  So that was that was the one thing that I screwed up was my time at Walnut Canyon aid station
[1441.72s -> 1442.80s]  but
[1442.84s -> 1448.64s]  Other than that, I pretty much nailed it strategically. I think so. Yeah. Yeah, sounds like it
[1448.84s -> 1452.12s]  What did you have out there for crew and pacers? How many people? I
[1452.88s -> 1459.28s]  Had a lot like way more than I've ever had before. I mean the satisfy running guys who are my sponsors they
[1460.44s -> 1462.24s]  They had me know
[1462.24s -> 1467.00s]  photographers and plus, you know just guys from the company there so they were crewing and
[1468.00s -> 1470.56s]  Also, one of the guys was pacing and
[1471.20s -> 1478.16s]  Then again just being a local and just like my all of my friends able to come out like my my good friend James Madsen
[1479.44s -> 1485.04s]  Who's paced me at pretty much everything like I think I almost killed him on the Arizona trail
[1485.84s -> 1489.00s]  He's been involved in almost every major thing I've ever done
[1489.84s -> 1492.88s]  fashion and he and I just have a really good rapport and
[1493.88s -> 1499.48s]  He's one of my best people out there for sure so to have him there was huge and he lives in Flagstaff
[1500.32s -> 1505.16s]  Lars Kraus like one of my main best friends climbing partners
[1506.60s -> 1511.98s]  Done so much with him. Like he just showed up my friend Jim who
[1513.00s -> 1517.72s]  I've actually been out working in the field with Lars and Jim this last week and next week and
[1518.32s -> 1522.20s]  so again, I had god, I don't know what that means I
[1522.92s -> 1529.24s]  And then like my girlfriend Maddie like just like that's like eight people, you know or something that were there
[1529.24s -> 1533.04s]  And I had I had a pacer so I had somebody pacing with me from
[1533.68s -> 1540.40s]  Mile 72 or whatever that first spot that pacers are I had somebody with me the whole time. Oh, wow
[1540.80s -> 1545.12s]  Yeah, which which is insane, which again, I wasn't really involved in
[1546.40s -> 1548.40s]  like I I didn't
[1549.36s -> 1555.72s]  They just all figured it out and like I would come into an aid station and like Adam would be like
[1555.72s -> 1558.48s]  Oh, I'm doing this section with you. I'm like, all right, like what you know
[1558.48s -> 1562.28s]  I didn't really put in any energy into that or figure it out
[1562.28s -> 1567.40s]  But they they all did which was awesome for me to not have to worry about that. Yeah
[1569.56s -> 1576.80s]  But yeah, so it was I mean I'm used to having you know, like one or two crews and like one pacer
[1576.80s -> 1578.80s]  you know, so it's like
[1579.76s -> 1581.36s]  This was
[1581.36s -> 1587.68s]  Different and cool in that way and I think a lot of runners had that sort of experience where they had a lot of different
[1587.80s -> 1594.60s]  Pacers hopping in and out and doing stuff like I know Jamil did and Jamil is like pretty notoriously doesn't use Pacers
[1594.60s -> 1600.88s]  Hmm, but I think he also had Pacers the entire time that was available. I think Maggie did too
[1602.48s -> 1603.96s]  But
[1603.96s -> 1605.56s]  Yeah
[1605.60s -> 1607.60s]  That's cool, man
[1607.92s -> 1612.36s]  Did you have a crew vehicle as well that you were able to sleep in like the back of a van?
[1612.36s -> 1619.44s]  Yeah, so the satisfy guys basically took over my Sprinter van. Okay, and so they had that at every crew
[1620.16s -> 1623.20s]  Accessible aid station. So it was actually I kind of felt bad because
[1624.44s -> 1628.14s]  One thing that you don't think about is when you're leading a race
[1628.36s -> 1631.80s]  especially a 250 mile race like you're usually out ahead by like
[1632.32s -> 1634.98s]  Four or five hours or something like that
[1635.56s -> 1642.44s]  So I actually and again, I had after the race, you know, I had time to sort of like have some
[1643.72s -> 1649.16s]  retrospect and think about these things was that those aid station crews like
[1649.84s -> 1656.64s]  They had to gear up and like get out there and get aid stations set up and like wake up in the middle of
[1656.64s -> 1661.32s]  The night like five hours before they would have had to if I wasn't out there
[1661.36s -> 1667.88s]  And there were so many times where I came into the aid station and they're all screaming and ringing their bells and it's like
[1668.00s -> 1672.96s]  Hey guys, and then I would just immediately go to the van and like wouldn't even
[1674.04s -> 1675.08s]  like
[1675.08s -> 1680.08s]  Take anything from the aid station do any because I'm a big like real food guy
[1680.08s -> 1682.44s]  Like I don't do aid station stuff very well
[1682.44s -> 1687.86s]  Like okay, I was so I was eating like burgers and pizzas and like the whole time. I was eating like big meals
[1687.86s -> 1689.02s]  Okay
[1689.02s -> 1694.06s]  So like I would just come in and go straight to the van like my crew would do everything for me
[1694.06s -> 1697.96s]  I would eat all of their food and I would leave and all the aid station people would be like, oh
[1699.30s -> 1701.30s]  so like I actually like
[1701.30s -> 1705.24s]  Apologize to a lot of the aid station because there was probably a lot of like build up in
[1705.78s -> 1707.78s]  anticipation and then like I would just like
[1708.66s -> 1710.38s]  Yeah
[1710.38s -> 1714.46s]  And then I'd have to wait like another few hours for Peter to come in. Yeah
[1714.54s -> 1718.86s]  Second, you know, yeah, and I guess isn't a big deal if it's the middle of day
[1718.86s -> 1724.18s]  but like some of those times were like three in the morning or something like that where they're all probably like
[1725.62s -> 1728.22s]  Dragging ass like out of bed and like
[1729.30s -> 1733.10s]  And then you just say hi and take off. Yeah, that's funny
[1735.38s -> 1741.30s]  What was your water strategy were you able to carry enough water most of the time were you dipping from streams?
[1742.18s -> 1744.10s]  I
[1744.10s -> 1747.80s]  was able to pretty much carry water the whole time I I
[1748.58s -> 1750.06s]  Think in a lot of ways
[1750.06s -> 1756.50s]  I'm a product of my environment and I do pretty well on low amounts of water actually to the chagrin of a lot
[1756.50s -> 1758.50s]  of my friends like I
[1759.54s -> 1764.38s]  Like in the canyon before I've definitely put some friends in some hairy situations
[1764.98s -> 1768.26s]  Like I do pretty well on low low amounts of water
[1768.26s -> 1776.38s]  But I mean that first I mean the now notorious like first 30 miles of the course
[1778.82s -> 1783.18s]  Even then like because I'm such a cocky asshole and I don't listen to anybody
[1783.62s -> 1789.42s]  Like no matter how many times they recommend to take three liters of water. Of course, I only took two liters
[1789.42s -> 1791.42s]  Oh really on that section and
[1793.10s -> 1798.18s]  Again, you know first day of the race like I'm pretty good with low water anyway
[1798.18s -> 1801.10s]  I was able to pull that off without too much difficulty
[1802.26s -> 1808.30s]  I actually didn't run out of water until maybe half a mile before the aid station
[1808.30s -> 1810.30s]  but I but I was also
[1810.82s -> 1815.38s]  Like I was pretty dehydrated when I got there because I was conserving so hard
[1815.38s -> 1821.10s]  So just because I didn't run out doesn't mean that I wasn't like conserving super hard that whole stretch. Mm-hmm
[1821.50s -> 1823.02s]  But
[1823.02s -> 1829.06s]  I also just don't have that much experience wearing a pack. Like I almost never wear a pack for anything
[1829.22s -> 1832.10s]  Yeah, and so I just
[1832.74s -> 1841.66s]  Even with two liters of water. I just thought I was gonna run out like immediately and I thought I had a lot
[1842.46s -> 1845.50s]  Less water than I did if that makes sense
[1846.22s -> 1852.10s]  So like I was conserving super hard and then like actually within the last few miles I like
[1852.82s -> 1856.08s]  Started to like chug water. I was like, oh, holy shit. There's like still water
[1856.78s -> 1861.90s]  Like I didn't need to like conserve so hard. Yeah, so like it I pulled it off
[1863.30s -> 1868.90s]  Okay, too. I think also during that section and again, I don't know if this is like this might get me like disqualified
[1868.90s -> 1871.50s]  Or whatever. I don't really know what the rules are. I don't really care
[1872.70s -> 1874.70s]  but I also like for
[1875.82s -> 1880.02s]  People and I don't know if this will turn less than listeners on or off or whatever
[1880.02s -> 1885.38s]  Like who's listening to this anyways, but like I did some mushrooms at the beginning of the race. Oh
[1886.26s -> 1887.42s]  and
[1887.42s -> 1894.26s]  Like I didn't do that many but like I I'm I typically like sort of micro dose just for like mental health
[1894.26s -> 1896.26s]  Yeah, yeah
[1898.22s -> 1904.42s]  There's a pretty funny photo of me of like that's the satisfy running photographer took at the start line of me just like cramming
[1904.42s -> 1906.42s]  mushrooms
[1907.34s -> 1911.78s]  So like I think I was definitely like feeling really good on that section and I was like
[1911.78s -> 1916.42s]  I'm not a super chatty guy like in life or in general, but I was like
[1917.02s -> 1919.02s]  Chatting it up with everybody
[1919.26s -> 1920.98s]  like like
[1920.98s -> 1923.98s]  Just so I was doing pretty good on that section
[1925.50s -> 1931.78s]  For a while and then I think you know that started to wear off and then I started to like think more about
[1932.34s -> 1934.34s]  Drinking water and like just
[1935.14s -> 1941.42s]  And then by the time I drew caught me drew caught me and we kind of came into that aid station together
[1941.42s -> 1943.22s]  Like I was feeling pretty
[1943.22s -> 1945.22s]  pretty gnarly and drew and I basically
[1946.26s -> 1949.58s]  Said the exact same thing to each other were like Jesus Christ man
[1949.58s -> 1953.42s]  Like we're supposed to be good at this, you know, and that was fucking gnarly like that was hard
[1953.90s -> 1956.30s]  Like the mid and back of the Packers are like
[1956.50s -> 1957.70s]  Like
[1957.70s -> 1964.02s]  You know like and I mean most people got through it and it's like that's the thing about all of this is like the
[1964.02s -> 1968.44s]  things that people are complaining about with like with the race or with the course or with like
[1968.86s -> 1970.90s]  Course markings or like all this stuff
[1970.90s -> 1977.70s]  It's like it's all stuff that like if you're capable of finishing a 250 mile or like you're capable of figuring it out
[1977.70s -> 1984.34s]  Like getting it done. So there was not like don't let any of these things that you hear about like this or that like
[1984.98s -> 1993.22s]  Like if you're capable of doing a 250 mile race to the like rugged central Arizona then like there was nothing out there that was
[1993.22s -> 1999.42s]  Like you shouldn't have been able to like get through. Yeah, you know, like this is not like a rock-and-roll marathon
[1999.42s -> 2003.58s]  You know, like it's like this is a different breed of
[2004.30s -> 2010.70s]  Race and person out there and like so yeah shit was hard and like shit was space far apart
[2010.70s -> 2013.80s]  But it's like it's a hard fucking thing and it should be yeah
[2014.86s -> 2019.06s]  You know, and we all got through it heard most of us in most of you. Yeah
[2019.06s -> 2022.78s]  I mean there were over a hundred finish. I mean, it's like that's crazy
[2022.78s -> 2027.42s]  I can't believe like over a hundred people did that right, right?
[2027.90s -> 2029.90s]  And they were out there for a lot longer than you
[2030.78s -> 2035.98s]  right, which I talk about all the time with people because I'm just self-deprecating I guess but like
[2036.50s -> 2040.54s]  Like what's more impressive? I mean in ultra running in general, you know what I mean?
[2040.54s -> 2046.90s]  Like what's more impressive the guy who runs a hundred-miler in 15 hours or the guy who does it in 30 totally because
[2047.42s -> 2049.62s]  Efforts probably the same. Mm-hmm
[2050.14s -> 2055.10s]  You know, but that guy's running for twice as long as the guy in the front the guy in the front just happens
[2055.10s -> 2059.38s]  To be like genetically blessed, you know, like what's more impressive?
[2059.38s -> 2062.62s]  I'm gonna have I like basketball and I like, you know the Phoenix Sun
[2062.62s -> 2064.42s]  So I'm gonna throw a basketball reference in there
[2064.42s -> 2067.70s]  but like what's more important like Shaquille O'Neal who's like
[2068.02s -> 2071.34s]  Seven feet tall and 300 pounds or like Muggsy Bogues
[2071.86s -> 2076.50s]  Like that guy's five foot one was an all-star like that shits impressive
[2076.50s -> 2080.94s]  You know, I mean like so that's what I sort of mean like the guys in the front of the race like
[2081.22s -> 2082.46s]  The guys in the back
[2082.46s -> 2087.26s]  I mean there certainly are people in the back in the mid pack that are like out there taking their time and like
[2087.26s -> 2093.24s]  Taking photos and enjoying it. Some of those guys are trying just and gals are trying just as hard as the winners
[2093.36s -> 2098.78s]  But they're doing it for twice as long, yeah, that's crazy like that's more impressive to me
[2099.68s -> 2101.36s]  then a
[2101.36s -> 2104.00s]  Lot of a lot of the winning times for sure
[2106.44s -> 2107.96s]  So
[2107.96s -> 2113.96s]  You brought up the micro dosing thing. So yeah, I want to talk to you about that because I find that pretty interesting
[2113.96s -> 2115.96s]  I used to experiment with
[2116.20s -> 2121.68s]  You know, I mean I've had my heyday with psychedelics back in the day, but I would experiment with
[2122.36s -> 2128.40s]  You know low doses of LSD while going out in the mountains and just going on big training runs and stuff
[2129.80s -> 2134.24s]  How big of a dose did you take and what in did you re up?
[2134.32s -> 2139.12s]  Because it seems weird that you would take it at the beginning of the race rather than maybe the end of the race
[2139.84s -> 2144.56s]  Yeah, actually my my initial plan was to take it that third day
[2145.32s -> 2147.56s]  To kind of like maybe even take a lot
[2147.88s -> 2154.20s]  Yeah, and I think it just sort of got lost in the shuffle and I was like so out of my mind anyways
[2155.04s -> 2157.04s]  That like I was scared
[2157.96s -> 2165.44s]  I've never done that before so I think pre-race I had talked about doing that but when it actually came to that like
[2166.12s -> 2168.04s]  third day I
[2168.04s -> 2173.92s]  Was scared to introduce something that I had never tried before and I didn't know how I was gonna react to it
[2174.12s -> 2177.40s]  Now typically like you're right like the super low doses
[2179.84s -> 2182.88s]  Like you don't really feel high you don't feel anything
[2183.04s -> 2186.76s]  Yeah, like and so when when I'm doing it for like mental health reasons
[2187.12s -> 2191.80s]  like I take an amount that like I don't ever feel you just
[2192.68s -> 2196.36s]  Catch yourself like you'll catch yourself that night. Oh
[2197.56s -> 2199.56s]  Like I'm in a good mood
[2199.56s -> 2204.64s]  Like I'm enjoying myself like when was the last time I enjoyed myself at like a
[2205.64s -> 2211.84s]  Family gathering or something, you know, and that's all that's the only way you really know that you took anything
[2213.04s -> 2218.20s]  now now occasionally when I head out to run like if I'm gonna go on like a four or five hour run like I'll take
[2218.20s -> 2223.96s]  Like two or three times that and I will like feel it a little bit because I think that's really fun to just like
[2223.96s -> 2226.56s]  Now again, you're not tripping. You're not you're not
[2227.12s -> 2233.52s]  Like what people typically associate with mushrooms or LSD like you're not you're not experiencing that
[2234.36s -> 2240.14s]  But you're experiencing colors. You're experiencing the landscape in a much more like vivid way
[2240.14s -> 2247.28s]  And for me what mushrooms do is it it it sort of allows me to stop being used to things
[2248.12s -> 2254.50s]  You know this I feel like when we become accustomed to things like things sort of lose their magic a little bit
[2255.50s -> 2259.02s]  But like the Grand Canyon is a really good example like I have friends that have grown up
[2259.02s -> 2262.98s]  You know three hours from the Grand Canyon and have never been there before
[2263.50s -> 2267.62s]  Because when you grow up next to something or like when you're accustomed to something
[2268.46s -> 2272.02s]  You just get used to it and you don't really appreciate it for what it is
[2272.02s -> 2278.66s]  like mushrooms sort of allow me to like go run in Granite Mountain wilderness, which I like live right next to and
[2278.82s -> 2285.10s]  I've grown up going there to go there at like sunset and be like this place is fucking amazing
[2285.10s -> 2288.40s]  Yeah, you know like that's really cool like and so
[2289.30s -> 2294.50s]  So for the race again to get back to the race like I thought it'd definitely be fun to like, you know
[2294.50s -> 2297.98s]  Take a little bit more. So I sort of did that. I I probably took
[2298.94s -> 2305.34s]  Well, so for example, the the typical dosage for like tripping with mushrooms is typically like an eighth of an ounce
[2306.14s -> 2309.90s]  With micro dosing you usually take like a tenth of that
[2311.46s -> 2316.62s]  And you do it like every few days or people have different strategies, it's sort of whatever works for you
[2317.58s -> 2324.22s]  But I probably took like a quarter of an eighth. I would say okay
[2324.62s -> 2329.24s]  So like a quarter of the mouth. So yeah, I didn't take a lot but I was definitely like
[2329.88s -> 2335.96s]  Feeling it out there and feeling good for like that hour like two to four or something like
[2337.20s -> 2341.64s]  Enjoying myself for sure. Yeah, but again, it just it got to the point where I
[2342.36s -> 2347.72s]  didn't know how it would affect me later in the stages and I could just got to the point where like I
[2348.92s -> 2354.76s]  Wasn't willing to kind of do anything that I didn't have like supreme confidence for sure
[2355.56s -> 2357.08s]  Yeah
[2357.08s -> 2364.26s]  So did you end up re-upping later on in the race or I never did never did yeah. Yeah, I never did. Okay
[2365.60s -> 2369.00s]  Just yeah. Yeah, that's cool, man. I mean
[2370.40s -> 2372.16s]  You know there
[2372.16s -> 2376.00s]  UFC fighters they all experiment with the same thing when they go into fight
[2376.00s -> 2382.96s]  A lot of them are taking really low doses of mushrooms because they can almost read what their opponent's doing before they do it
[2383.00s -> 2387.52s]  You know, I think it adds a lot of clarity for clarity like heightened awareness
[2388.32s -> 2391.96s]  Yeah, that's it's pretty crazy man and it allows you to be very objective
[2393.32s -> 2399.00s]  it's sort of like so to you know sort of tie in the mental health thing again, like
[2399.56s -> 2403.88s]  you know and things that people struggle with with mental health like I
[2404.92s -> 2408.68s]  Could like unload on you right now everything that makes me feel bad
[2408.68s -> 2413.08s]  You know what I mean or like everything that causes stress or everything that causes anxiety or depression
[2413.28s -> 2417.72s]  And you would hear those things and you would be empathetic towards those things
[2417.84s -> 2421.56s]  But you wouldn't feel those things the way I feel those things
[2422.44s -> 2429.12s]  Right, you would be able to look at those things from a very objective standpoint and say I understand why that causes you stress
[2430.12s -> 2436.76s]  But I don't feel stressed because of that, right? So for me it almost allows me to that like hyper
[2437.40s -> 2442.32s]  Objectivity we're like I can look at the things of my life and sort of create this like
[2443.56s -> 2446.28s]  Meta mic almost and like look at myself
[2447.56s -> 2450.62s]  Objectively and say like yes, those things are like stressors
[2451.32s -> 2455.36s]  But I'm able to sort of just like put them over there for a minute
[2455.36s -> 2462.12s]  Yeah, and not allow them to affect me the way that I would if I was being if they were like super internal
[2462.44s -> 2463.68s]  Mm-hmm
[2463.68s -> 2468.28s]  So it's almost the opposite I think of what like a lot of people would think if you like took mushrooms
[2468.28s -> 2471.92s]  You know, they like have these ideas of these like psychedelic like trips or whatever
[2471.92s -> 2477.80s]  but like for me it almost makes me like hyper rational and and and objective and I'm able to
[2478.32s -> 2479.96s]  like sort of
[2479.96s -> 2487.20s]  Compartmentalize my emotions a little better and just sort of deal with them instead of I deal with them in an objective rational manner
[2488.04s -> 2489.80s]  instead of
[2490.48s -> 2492.48s]  Emotional irrational manner
[2493.12s -> 2498.92s]  and so for me that that's been a really big help and I'm I'm also like I'm not I I
[2499.84s -> 2507.36s]  Think you know, I don't want to get too off off topic here, but I you know, or go too far down the rabbit hole of like
[2508.84s -> 2514.44s]  Pharmaceuticals and things like that, but I've always been deathly afraid of you know for-profit
[2515.56s -> 2518.00s]  pharmaceutical companies and you know and
[2520.32s -> 2521.72s]  Like
[2521.72s -> 2526.64s]  Mushrooms the I've never taken antidepressants. I've never I've never
[2528.12s -> 2531.32s]  dealt with any of sort of those chemical treatments and
[2532.00s -> 2538.16s]  Some mushrooms for me like they seem to really work. They're they're very low risk. There's zero side effects
[2538.16s -> 2540.00s]  there's zero share of
[2540.00s -> 2541.84s]  consequences and
[2541.84s -> 2546.14s]  It seems like a no-brainer if it you know if it's making and you know
[2546.18s -> 2548.18s]  I've talked to a lot of people and it's like
[2548.30s -> 2552.38s]  you know you and I would have never brought it up unless I brought it up and it's like
[2552.66s -> 2557.06s]  You start to find out like oh like you do that too. Like oh you do that too
[2557.06s -> 2561.86s]  Oh, you do that too. Like like it's a lot more prevalent than people realize, you know
[2561.98s -> 2567.34s]  even out there like running on the trail like I was like running with wit, you know, and like we were I was like
[2567.98s -> 2572.62s]  Was like dude. I was like hey, I did a bunch of mushrooms. Oh, that's so awesome
[2572.66s -> 2577.62s]  Started telling me all about his experiences was like all of that, you know and like
[2578.86s -> 2582.02s]  We're like Dylan the photo. I shouldn't be telling people this
[2583.30s -> 2586.74s]  Like race photographers like yeah, the second time I did the Arizona trail
[2586.74s -> 2590.94s]  I did the whole thing like micro dosing on LSD and it's like and it's like yeah
[2590.94s -> 2595.94s]  It's like a lot like it helps a lot of people. I feel like it's really helpful to a lot of people
[2595.94s -> 2600.10s]  Yeah in a very non-destructive way, which is awesome. Yeah. Yep
[2600.10s -> 2608.10s]  No, I recommend it to everybody I mean, it's like it's I do I really do like even like my mom and my aunt
[2608.38s -> 2610.58s]  you know and like in just I've
[2611.86s -> 2612.94s]  I've
[2612.94s -> 2618.02s]  Recommended it to a lot of people and like I said, it's it's it's pretty low risk
[2618.02s -> 2620.86s]  And it's like the worst thing that's gonna happen to you
[2620.86s -> 2626.18s]  If you like take a little bit too much is like you'll think the sunset is super pretty, right?
[2626.26s -> 2630.74s]  It's like that's the worst side effect right right. Yeah. Yeah
[2631.54s -> 2634.02s]  yeah, I'm sure we could talk longer on this subject, but
[2635.02s -> 2637.50s]  No, yeah, I do find it interesting and
[2638.42s -> 2644.20s]  Interesting that you took it at the beginning of the race. That's it seems a little a little nutty to me like
[2645.38s -> 2652.90s]  Closer to the end of the race makes more sense. But yeah, I actually in hindsight sort of regret not being more like
[2653.90s -> 2657.58s]  Probably not doing that I kind of wish that I had
[2659.22s -> 2665.70s]  But again, I was just that last night was such that last night was such a blur for me that I was like
[2666.50s -> 2674.56s]  Just moving in and out of weird states of like consciousness and an awakeness and like just
[2676.08s -> 2681.32s]  Hurting bad and wanting to get over. I don't know like it was
[2681.36s -> 2683.36s]  It was I
[2683.96s -> 2685.96s]  Wish I was I was more
[2686.56s -> 2688.64s]  coherent to sort of like
[2689.12s -> 2696.81s]  Take care of myself better or like do that do those things that like probably would have helped a lot
[2696.81s -> 2703.33s]  Like I actually think it if I had re-upped on like day two and three. I think that would have helped a lot
[2703.73s -> 2706.89s]  Mm-hmm with my attitude mostly. Yeah
[2706.89s -> 2707.25s]  Sure
[2707.25s -> 2712.81s]  I was I was pretty bitchy for a lot of some of those sections like those night sections like those
[2713.41s -> 2719.65s]  Midnight to 5 a.m. Sections were pretty dark out there sometimes and I think it would have been a really big help
[2719.65s -> 2723.31s]  If I had been a little bit more proactive with that, but you know
[2724.17s -> 2726.53s]  Can't do it perfectly. Yeah. Yeah
[2727.97s -> 2729.97s]  You mentioned that you pushed really hard
[2731.05s -> 2736.61s]  you know the first 30 miles and then subsequently the first hundred and thirty miles to but like
[2738.05s -> 2741.49s]  What was the effort level throughout most of the 250 like
[2742.45s -> 2748.57s]  Was there sections you were really hammering or were you just kind of on cruise all day long or um, I
[2748.97s -> 2752.35s]  Would say that for level is generally pretty low
[2755.29s -> 2762.85s]  The biggest thing for me were just just my fucking feet and legs hurt really so like and they were just like getting
[2762.85s -> 2765.85s]  Real tight, you know, so like there was just countless times
[2766.85s -> 2768.45s]  That I
[2768.45s -> 2771.65s]  Would stop and have my pacer like stretch me out
[2771.89s -> 2778.73s]  Okay on the side of the trail that was really the limiting factor for me was just the pain in my in my feet and legs
[2779.73s -> 2785.41s]  And that wasn't any it wasn't anything to not be expected like and it was just
[2786.73s -> 2789.65s]  Muscle and bones aching, you know that and
[2791.77s -> 2795.57s]  So that sort of kept me from going too fast really
[2796.81s -> 2798.37s]  but
[2798.37s -> 2802.21s]  the one thing I could do without any pain at all was
[2802.93s -> 2806.53s]  Climb and and climb pretty fast. Nice
[2808.01s -> 2813.33s]  So like I actually there was one night like in the middle of that like my James again to bring up my pacer James
[2813.33s -> 2818.53s]  like he kept laughing because he said like everything I was doing for those last like day and a half was like
[2819.25s -> 2825.61s]  Completely opposite of what like most people need out of a pacer, you know, like I would come into an aid station
[2825.65s -> 2830.53s]  Be like alright James like let's like let's let's streamline this a little bit like let's get in and out
[2830.53s -> 2831.89s]  You know, I'm gonna like sit down
[2831.89s -> 2834.97s]  I'm gonna like do this and then I and then I need to get out of there, you know
[2834.97s -> 2841.93s]  And it's like we're like that that there's this long stretch in between walnut Canyon before you actually get to the big climb
[2841.93s -> 2848.61s]  on Eldon and he like there was one moment where I just like completely laid down on the trail just like so exhausted and
[2848.61s -> 2850.09s]  Overwhelmed I'm like
[2850.09s -> 2856.05s]  Jesus Christ James like I just want to get to the fucking climb like I just want to start climbing right?
[2856.05s -> 2857.49s]  That's all I want to do right now
[2857.49s -> 2861.89s]  I was like and then I finally got to the climb and it like that was the one thing that didn't hurt
[2861.89s -> 2865.73s]  You know, so like on the climbs, I feel like I was like probably pushing pretty hard
[2866.25s -> 2870.37s]  okay, and like harnessing my Anthony Culpepper just like
[2871.13s -> 2876.25s]  Power hiking the shit out of things. Yeah, you know and like that felt actually pretty good
[2877.25s -> 2883.05s]  To be able to do those things I was actually more worried about the descent off of Eldon than I was the climb of it
[2883.29s -> 2885.21s]  Okay
[2885.21s -> 2890.41s]  Just because it's a hard road for a lot of it and it's like but
[2892.25s -> 2896.61s]  Overall, I mean I think that like and then you know
[2896.61s -> 2902.19s]  There were a couple of times where like you find like you get little bursts of energy and like you're on smooth
[2902.59s -> 2908.23s]  Trail that's like slightly downhill and like you're coming into an aid station or whatever
[2908.23s -> 2913.55s]  And it's like like my other pacer gym has been giving me a lot of shit for like hamming it up for the cameras
[2913.55s -> 2915.55s]  Like coming into Fort Tudhill or whatever
[2915.99s -> 2918.63s]  and it's like well, you know again like
[2922.47s -> 2926.91s]  In these things you use anything you can possibly find as a motivator
[2926.91s -> 2933.35s]  Yeah, and and like, you know call it narcissism call it whatever you want to like
[2934.47s -> 2941.07s]  when I'm like when I hit a smooth part of trail and it's slightly downhill and I see Derek like over there with a
[2941.07s -> 2943.07s]  camera and like I know that like
[2943.95s -> 2947.47s]  you know thousands of people are watching on the live stream like
[2948.15s -> 2949.23s]  like
[2949.23s -> 2952.23s]  Use it as a motivator. Yeah, you know, like it's
[2952.67s -> 2959.07s]  You might as well like and like don't sit down on the side of the trail for 10 minutes when there's like cameras
[2959.07s -> 2960.75s]  on you, you know, like
[2960.75s -> 2966.75s]  Let's hammer this out like let's run fast and like if you can use that as a motivator and again like use those
[2967.39s -> 2971.83s]  hormones and those endorphins and all that to like to your advantage like
[2972.71s -> 2975.27s]  You can pick it apart and say that it was one thing
[2975.27s -> 2980.39s]  but really it's just finding any excuse for motivation to like try and like
[2981.11s -> 2984.99s]  Get some miles under your belt, you know, sure. Yeah, it's like
[2985.91s -> 2992.23s]  So, yeah, or like the same thing with the finish, you know coming into the I mean the finish is like this long stretch of
[2992.75s -> 2996.23s]  slightly downhill roads, you know, or it's just like
[2997.47s -> 3001.99s]  Yeah, like we're almost there. The sun's coming up. Like let's open it up and like
[3001.99s -> 3009.03s]  Yeah, like let's like I don't have to get up after again after the finish line, you know, like let's do this. Like, let's
[3009.91s -> 3013.83s]  Let's create a moment, you know for myself and for everyone watching
[3013.99s -> 3015.99s]  Which is cool, you know, yeah, totally
[3016.79s -> 3019.91s]  Yeah, I mean all those little hacks almost
[3020.79s -> 3029.67s]  They all count like, you know, if I'm running a hundred mile race and I'm smiling at people and cheering them on it's also cheering myself up
[3029.67s -> 3036.23s]  You know, and yeah, it's that adrenaline like like racing in Europe when you come into those towns and there's hundreds of people like
[3036.23s -> 3039.03s]  They're watching you and cheering you and yelling. It's like
[3039.75s -> 3041.75s]  What a fucking motivator
[3042.23s -> 3046.87s]  What a fucking motivator it's like it's so much adrenaline it feels so good like
[3047.43s -> 3050.39s]  Yeah, use it like get in there like get out of there then like
[3051.03s -> 3055.75s]  you can crash again when you get out of like when you get out of the towns or whatever, you know,
[3055.83s -> 3057.83s]  like catch your breath or whatever, but
[3058.63s -> 3064.55s]  Yeah, sorry not to interrupt you. No, no, no, that's not at all. Um describe the the
[3065.27s -> 3070.71s]  Finish and before the finish like the last I don't know. I'm throwing a number out there 10 or 15 miles
[3071.03s -> 3075.83s]  Yeah, what was going through your head and then as you come into the finish of you know
[3076.15s -> 3082.47s]  This race where you know all kinds of people. Yeah, it's it's your stomping ground. What was just the whole experience like
[3083.03s -> 3085.51s]  um, well I can tell you the last like
[3086.39s -> 3090.55s]  Five miles I and I remember this because I actually vocalized it to James
[3090.55s -> 3094.95s]  it's like probably the only words that I said to anybody on those last five miles was
[3095.91s -> 3101.19s]  How much I really wasn't excited about the finish because I knew how many people I was gonna have to talk to
[3101.91s -> 3107.51s]  And I knew how there were gonna be cameras and interviews and just like all the like and I didn't want to talk to anybody
[3107.99s -> 3110.15s]  I just wanted to finish. I wanted to like
[3110.87s -> 3115.83s]  Go lay down in my van and like take my shoes off and just yeah like relax and
[3116.87s -> 3121.83s]  But I mean even I said that but I remember even when I did get to the finish like that that
[3122.31s -> 3127.43s]  That changed I was fine like seeing people and talking to people and um, but
[3129.11s -> 3131.11s]  Yeah, I I really wasn't
[3132.39s -> 3134.39s]  Super excited
[3134.63s -> 3137.27s]  Those last few miles like um
[3140.15s -> 3144.15s]  I don't know why I think I was just depleted. You know, I think I was just
[3145.27s -> 3147.27s]  in like
[3147.99s -> 3150.47s]  At that point too like and again
[3151.43s -> 3157.03s]  I had I let me let me preface what I'm about to say by saying like I have no problem at all with the with
[3157.03s -> 3162.15s]  The live coverage and the cameras and I think it was awesome. I think it was so cool and like
[3162.87s -> 3169.19s]  But that shit was pretty fucking annoying for a little while like especially like climbing up elden and like these are not
[3170.39s -> 3171.43s]  You know
[3171.43s -> 3174.55s]  These are not pretty moments for a lot of us
[3175.51s -> 3180.31s]  You know and like yeah like having a camera up your ass climbing elden for hours
[3180.55s -> 3181.75s]  and then like
[3181.75s -> 3185.67s]  Running with you for those like last five miles like coming into the finish
[3185.67s -> 3190.23s]  Like I get it and like especially now after the fact because like oh that was pretty awesome
[3190.31s -> 3194.87s]  Sure, but at that point in the race, like you're looking to take out your your
[3196.55s -> 3199.91s]  Feelings on anything and on anybody
[3200.55s -> 3205.43s]  And if there's a guy with a camera there like i'm just going to take that out on you and i'm going to blame
[3205.51s -> 3208.55s]  You for everything, right? You know what I mean? Like a type of a thing
[3209.11s -> 3211.11s]  So it's like um
[3211.51s -> 3214.39s]  So by the time I actually got to the finish
[3215.03s -> 3217.59s]  um
[3217.59s -> 3223.43s]  I really didn't like have this moment that I was finishing until I feel like maybe I hit
[3224.23s -> 3226.23s]  town in flagstaff
[3227.03s -> 3231.27s]  And I started to see people and like like there were people waiting for me at buffalo park
[3231.51s -> 3233.51s]  with like arizona flags and like
[3234.47s -> 3236.47s]  a couple on a bike
[3236.55s -> 3240.63s]  Just like and the congratulations started and the cheering and the like
[3241.19s -> 3247.59s]  And then running out all through downtown and people like yelling out their windows like waking up first thing in the morning, you know, and
[3248.39s -> 3250.63s]  just hearing the downtown and then like
[3251.51s -> 3253.51s]  and again, i've I
[3253.67s -> 3258.31s]  Went to college in flagstaff and I used to live downtown. You know what I mean? So it's like
[3259.35s -> 3263.03s]  To be able to finish in that way like it's so cool and um
[3265.25s -> 3267.09s]  it's like
[3267.09s -> 3269.19s]  And then yeah getting to run into the finish
[3270.37s -> 3272.13s]  um
[3272.13s -> 3274.13s]  have
[3274.29s -> 3278.21s]  I didn't know my mom was there like my mom was in reno nevada, you know
[3278.21s -> 3280.53s]  I had no idea that she was going to be there and like
[3281.09s -> 3284.45s]  I came in like saw my crew and saw all these people and then you know
[3284.53s -> 3289.09s]  Obviously people are asking you questions trying like patty curry jamil's mom
[3290.13s -> 3291.81s]  um
[3291.81s -> 3293.49s]  Like came over
[3293.49s -> 3295.49s]  and was like tearing up
[3296.37s -> 3299.81s]  And like about to cry and just like gave me the biggest hug and like
[3300.93s -> 3302.13s]  and then
[3302.13s -> 3308.77s]  Which like means a lot for so many reasons just my whole relationship with that family and jamil and arabipa running over the last
[3308.83s -> 3310.45s]  decade but
[3310.45s -> 3311.49s]  and then
[3311.49s -> 3315.97s]  I saw my mom and I was like, oh like my mom is here like what like, you know, like
[3316.53s -> 3318.53s]  so I just like gave her a big hug and
[3319.49s -> 3322.45s]  um just every everybody was there, you know, like
[3323.17s -> 3325.17s]  That I had done everything with and
[3326.69s -> 3329.41s]  I think it was a really special moment not just for myself
[3329.41s -> 3334.61s]  but again to like go back to the curry family and the arabipa running and just the whole staff and
[3335.25s -> 3339.01s]  I have so much history with so many of those people and
[3340.29s -> 3347.01s]  Our stories with this sport are very interweaved and have sort of taken a very similar trajectory and
[3347.81s -> 3350.69s]  For this to be this sort of like big breakout moment
[3350.69s -> 3358.13s]  I feel like for arabipa running and just taking their whole race organization to that next level and this race
[3359.17s -> 3360.21s]  and
[3360.21s -> 3366.13s]  I think for me to be the one to win the inaugural year was really special not just for myself, but for
[3367.01s -> 3368.93s]  for so many
[3368.93s -> 3374.05s]  people involved with the race and jim and jamil hopefully jamil feels that way and
[3374.61s -> 3376.61s]  And I know that he does and
[3376.77s -> 3377.81s]  and patty
[3377.81s -> 3382.37s]  I mean that I mean anyone who saw patty come up to me and give me that hug who knew sort of a lot
[3382.37s -> 3389.49s]  of the behind the scenes things over the last five to ten years like sure how much that meant to me, you know, and
[3391.41s -> 3394.37s]  So that was that was really awesome. Yeah
[3395.33s -> 3398.85s]  Um, what was a a sweeter finish?
[3400.93s -> 3403.49s]  Like your arizona trail or the coca-dona 250?
[3405.01s -> 3407.01s]  What felt better to you?
[3410.66s -> 3415.54s]  Or are they not even comparable they're I mean, they're very different like um
[3417.38s -> 3419.38s]  The arizona trail was
[3420.58s -> 3428.02s]  So much harder than this and and and again not to take away from coca-dona at all. It was a burly thing but like
[3429.54s -> 3435.22s]  What I what I was going through and having to deal with on the arizona trail and then to complete that
[3435.78s -> 3440.34s]  Like that was that was a really crazy thing for me. Um
[3441.70s -> 3446.58s]  That was a really special thing for me and it was one of the very first things I feel like I had done in
[3446.58s -> 3448.42s]  my life where
[3448.42s -> 3450.10s]  I allowed myself
[3450.10s -> 3452.10s]  To feel pride
[3452.82s -> 3456.50s]  You know and that that's big for me and it was just
[3458.10s -> 3460.10s]  Such a crazy thing that
[3461.86s -> 3464.82s]  And then the the coca-dona was different, you know, like I didn't
[3468.37s -> 3475.49s]  I don't think winning races is that cool, you know, and probably not supposed to say that or whatever but like
[3476.21s -> 3481.17s]  I mean going back to what we said earlier about like what's harder the 15 or the 30 hour finisher
[3481.81s -> 3483.57s]  it's like
[3483.57s -> 3487.57s]  I think I you know, I think we all did the same thing out there
[3488.53s -> 3493.49s]  I just had a lot of things going for me and probably have longer legs than a lot of those people, you know, and
[3493.49s -> 3494.85s]  it's like
[3494.85s -> 3496.77s]  so I don't
[3496.77s -> 3501.81s]  It wasn't that I won that i'm super proud of i'm what i'm proud of is to like
[3503.17s -> 3507.73s]  To be a part of this event and get to share this like really special like
[3508.05s -> 3514.37s]  Like no one will ever take away from any of the runners of the inaugural year and the experience that we all had out there
[3515.41s -> 3522.13s]  Because this race is going to change, you know, it's like they're already talking about making it easier. It's like making it shorter and like
[3523.25s -> 3525.25s]  like
[3525.41s -> 3532.53s]  This is a it's it was a one-off for sure and it's like to be able to participate that and then again all those things I said about
[3533.49s -> 3535.01s]  being able to
[3535.01s -> 3539.01s]  The arizona trail was a very like selfish thing for lack of a better word
[3539.09s -> 3542.21s]  You know what I mean? Like it was very much like something I was doing
[3542.77s -> 3547.81s]  Even though I had a crew and I was like fully supported. It was like I was out there by myself
[3547.89s -> 3549.89s]  I was the only one doing it
[3550.13s -> 3552.85s]  so like this wasn't that this like
[3553.49s -> 3555.09s]  this was
[3555.09s -> 3561.33s]  To like from myself to andre like the dfl and like everyone in between like we all did something
[3563.01s -> 3568.21s]  Which is pretty awesome, we all did it together which is pretty awesome and like
[3569.41s -> 3573.57s]  There's just a lot more people involved in moving pieces and like
[3574.13s -> 3577.81s]  I'm more stoked for other people than I am myself and like
[3578.21s -> 3580.21s]  But again to be like the one and again
[3580.21s -> 3585.01s]  I understand being the leader and winning the race like a lot of the coverage and a lot of the tension gets
[3585.09s -> 3590.53s]  directed at me which is fine like like there's nothing wrong with that and and I understand why that is or like
[3591.17s -> 3593.81s]  why we glorify speed and things like that, but like
[3594.69s -> 3601.17s]  This was not like some competitive 50k or 50 mile where like guys are out there and gals gunning for each other
[3601.25s -> 3602.69s]  This was like
[3602.69s -> 3604.85s]  Like peter and I were never racing each other
[3605.09s -> 3609.89s]  You know, it's like we're both so stoked for each other to be able to do what we both did out there
[3610.37s -> 3615.09s]  And again, I feel that way about everyone who finished so it's it's just a very different emotion
[3615.17s -> 3618.69s]  And it's a very different feeling I have than the arizona trail
[3619.33s -> 3621.33s]  So I can't really answer that
[3622.53s -> 3627.49s]  Like yes or no type of way, you know, or black and white type of way. So it's like
[3628.13s -> 3629.01s]  but
[3629.01s -> 3631.01s]  Yeah, yeah
[3631.41s -> 3632.45s]  um
[3632.45s -> 3634.45s]  outside of this race or
[3635.01s -> 3638.21s]  Or the arizona trail like what inspires you?
[3638.69s -> 3639.89s]  Um
[3639.89s -> 3646.05s]  Whether it's to get outside and get out for a run or what inspires you elsewhere in life?
[3646.45s -> 3648.85s]  Like what turns you on and fires you up?
[3650.21s -> 3653.44s]  um, I
[3653.44s -> 3658.32s]  I think people getting outside of their comfort zones, you know is really big for me
[3658.48s -> 3664.00s]  I I really admire that and I try and do that as much as possible with myself and
[3664.96s -> 3671.04s]  Try and relearn things or or learn new things constantly and um
[3672.56s -> 3678.24s]  Sort of like push myself to see how far like like I admire that and other people
[3679.68s -> 3683.28s]  You know like nothing ever cool has ever been done by
[3684.32s -> 3688.56s]  like nothing ever like worth talking about has ever been accomplished by like
[3688.56s -> 3694.56s]  Like people who are like super content and comfortable and like happy, you know what I mean?
[3694.56s -> 3702.08s]  It's like whether that's like outdoor athletic feats or whether that's like art or music or any of that like
[3703.52s -> 3705.12s]  like
[3705.12s -> 3711.04s]  So I really admire people that explore those things because I feel like that's where like good art music and
[3712.00s -> 3714.00s]  and feats come from is by
[3714.88s -> 3718.00s]  Embracing those dark places and like pushing it
[3718.56s -> 3720.56s]  and seeing where it can take you and
[3721.12s -> 3724.44s]  um
[3724.44s -> 3729.40s]  Yeah, I think and that can be in anything, you know, that can be in construction that can be in
[3730.66s -> 3736.84s]  Podcasting, you know and in cooking food like I it doesn't matter what it is. I just think like
[3738.20s -> 3740.20s]  people that aren't afraid to
[3742.12s -> 3745.72s]  Push their boundary I I don't know I don't maybe that's a little generic but
[3746.44s -> 3750.12s]  It's it's true. I guess. Yeah. No, it makes sense
[3750.92s -> 3753.56s]  um, I watched one of your previous interviews and that
[3754.12s -> 3759.00s]  somebody said in there that you're a fan of hank williams, so i'm just thinking of like hank williams like
[3760.04s -> 3767.00s]  He must have gone deep into him his own psyche at some point to come up with those beautiful songs, right?
[3767.16s -> 3769.56s]  Like he pushed the boundaries. Yeah
[3770.04s -> 3772.68s]  Um, a lot of those songs are really fucking dark, man
[3772.84s -> 3776.52s]  Like they're not like they're not catchy country songs. Right, right
[3777.32s -> 3779.32s]  They're really dark. Yeah, absolutely
[3779.56s -> 3781.96s]  So like woody guthrie is the same way, you know
[3782.04s -> 3786.28s]  It's it's it's like like woody like I feel like all punk music and that whole
[3786.84s -> 3789.96s]  Everything that has evolved like I know woody guthrie doesn't get credit
[3790.04s -> 3792.84s]  But I feel like we all copy woody guthrie
[3793.24s -> 3798.92s]  Yeah, through like every aspect of our society like or anything that's respectable, you know, totally
[3799.32s -> 3801.32s]  Yeah, so it's like yeah, I mean the
[3802.92s -> 3804.20s]  Yeah
[3804.20s -> 3808.60s]  Yeah, and woody guthrie was copying folks that were around before him as well
[3809.16s -> 3811.16s]  He was extremely original
[3811.24s -> 3816.28s]  But he was drawing from other sources as well and that's just what we all do to build off of each other
[3817.00s -> 3817.64s]  and uh
[3817.64s -> 3821.56s]  It's like you got to feel that pain and you got to have that darkness in your life to
[3822.52s -> 3826.68s]  Sort of blossom and accomplish cool new things that have never been done before
[3827.16s -> 3827.88s]  Yeah
[3827.88s -> 3831.48s]  Yeah, again to sort of repeat myself. I don't think anything cool has ever been
[3832.04s -> 3837.64s]  Done by like happy content comfortable people right sitting on the couch accomplishes nothing
[3837.64s -> 3843.00s]  You can send me you can email me some examples or something, but i'll probably find a reason to tear it down
[3844.28s -> 3846.28s]  Totally totally
[3846.52s -> 3848.52s]  um
[3848.52s -> 3850.52s]  Well, cool, man. I mean
[3850.52s -> 3852.92s]  This is a totally different interview than what we did yesterday
[3853.00s -> 3856.52s]  It was actually I said like we should just get all the like
[3856.52s -> 3860.04s]  I know I already said this is out of the way but I feel like it was kind of a different interview
[3860.12s -> 3866.92s]  Totally, yeah better interview too. Yeah, me too. We concentrated on the race more and yeah, I dug it man. So
[3867.56s -> 3871.64s]  um, I think we pretty much covered it any anything else you want to throw in here at the end just
[3872.36s -> 3874.52s]  for shits and giggles
[3874.52s -> 3880.76s]  Um god, I don't know. I don't know what's next. I mean there's you know, that's a big question. I keep getting
[3882.52s -> 3884.52s]  What are some like really
[3884.52s -> 3888.04s]  We're gonna have a big uh, when when do you think this will go out for you?
[3888.84s -> 3892.20s]  This should be out next tuesday. Okay. Yeah
[3893.64s -> 3899.32s]  So, yeah, there's a lot of the satisfied running guys are putting together a lot of content and a lot of
[3900.20s -> 3902.44s]  Tell us about them on the race. They uh
[3903.16s -> 3909.64s]  They're doing this whole like sort of cocadona chronicles series where they're releasing a lot of photos and a lot of words
[3910.52s -> 3915.80s]  Um, i'm going to be doing a a race report but not sort of in your typical race report fashion
[3915.80s -> 3917.80s]  there's a lot of uh
[3918.28s -> 3919.54s]  sort of
[3919.54s -> 3925.16s]  References to different aspects of the race, but sort of what's going on in the back of my head the whole time
[3925.88s -> 3926.92s]  and
[3926.92s -> 3933.32s]  so like i'm currently talking about, you know, all the dragons and dwarves all over the bradshaw mountains and
[3935.00s -> 3938.92s]  The satisfied guys want to hire like an illustrator to come in and do this whole
[3939.88s -> 3945.40s]  Metal album artwork to kind of go along with so and then they're they're releasing
[3945.72s -> 3953.08s]  Uh, they're releasing a big interview with a lot again with a lot of words and a lot of pictures tomorrow, which is friday, so
[3954.36s -> 3957.16s]  This will be three or four days before this comes out
[3958.52s -> 3963.40s]  But I mean there will be continuous stuff coming out. We're doing a big q a on well
[3963.40s -> 3966.44s]  They're doing a big q a on instagram. I'm not
[3967.88s -> 3974.76s]  Super hip with the jive of social media, but so they're sort of doing everything for me, but
[3976.12s -> 3978.52s]  A big q a tomorrow, I think
[3980.60s -> 3986.28s]  So, yeah, I mean there's stuff for people and I think this will be a pretty informative thing for people to listen to
[3987.32s -> 3990.36s]  Sort of if they have any questions and totally 100
[3991.48s -> 3992.36s]  Yeah
[3992.36s -> 3998.28s]  Again, I don't really know what's coming up, but i'm pretty impulsive. I'll hop into something somewhere. So yeah
[3998.76s -> 4000.44s]  You see my name again
[4000.52s -> 4007.48s]  I have a feeling i'm probably gonna get invited to or get sucked into doing some of these other 200s probably
[4008.44s -> 4015.80s]  So, um that might be on the radar. I don't you know, I don't know. We'll see I am itching to do another fkt
[4016.68s -> 4018.60s]  um
[4018.60s -> 4023.24s]  So, you know, there's there's a lot of people kind of pushing me to
[4024.12s -> 4026.12s]  Go after the azt again
[4026.20s -> 4027.80s]  Um
[4027.80s -> 4032.60s]  I don't know. That's crazy. I mean joe is doing 70 plus miles a day. Yeah
[4033.16s -> 4035.48s]  13 days legit. Yeah, so
[4036.60s -> 4040.68s]  So, yeah, I don't know if I can do that. But like I don't so we'll see, you know
[4041.40s -> 4044.12s]  um there there's always things and they pop up and
[4045.32s -> 4049.96s]  Um, you know the world's opening again. So yeah, you know, we're getting there
[4050.44s -> 4055.16s]  Um as far as fkt's I mean the arizona trail you're really familiar with it
[4055.40s -> 4057.64s]  It's it's it's sort of your turf
[4058.28s -> 4059.24s]  um
[4059.24s -> 4064.68s]  Do you ever think about going out of state and trying to do anything or do you try and stick with like I noticed that?
[4064.68s -> 4065.80s]  You did
[4065.80s -> 4070.68s]  Fkt on mount sneffels. I think it was last year. Yeah, one of our colorado 14ers
[4071.08s -> 4073.80s]  Yeah, I I live I can't really say I live there
[4073.80s -> 4079.16s]  But I I typically probably spend three or four months out of the year in silverton colorado. Okay for hard rock
[4080.12s -> 4083.80s]  Well, i'm not necessarily for hard rock. I'm usually there for hard rock
[4084.28s -> 4087.80s]  I've never run hard rock. Yeah, i've gotten in but um
[4089.64s -> 4094.04s]  Uh, there's a few other races that I really like to do there like the john capas race
[4094.12s -> 4096.20s]  which we've done in the last few years, which is like
[4097.14s -> 4101.16s]  20,000 feet of climbing and like 28 miles or something like that
[4101.88s -> 4103.32s]  And it's I mean, it's not really a race
[4103.32s -> 4108.28s]  It's more of a group run glorified group run that james varner of rain shadow running
[4108.52s -> 4113.00s]  It's on so that's like a really cool race and that I like to do up there every year
[4113.00s -> 4116.28s]  And I usually hop into some of jamil's races up if i'm up there
[4117.08s -> 4122.60s]  At that time but but I just really like that the san juan's and like a lot of us do
[4122.84s -> 4126.36s]  You know and and so i'm able to spend quite a bit of time up there every year
[4126.36s -> 4129.16s]  And I have a lot of friends that live in silverton. So i'm able to just
[4130.60s -> 4134.36s]  Park the van and you know base out of there. So
[4135.48s -> 4137.48s]  I'm excited to get back there
[4137.96s -> 4139.96s]  this summer
[4140.60s -> 4145.64s]  And yeah, we'll see. Um, I mean the like the snuffles fkt and
[4147.00s -> 4153.08s]  I you know, i've had a few other ones around there, but like I haven't gotten too into the fkt thing the
[4154.36s -> 4161.96s]  The I did I did set an fkt on orisa pico de orzaba in mexico. It's like the highest point in mexico a few years ago
[4162.76s -> 4165.88s]  It's like 18 and a half thousand feet and it's like sort of a
[4166.28s -> 4171.32s]  It's more of an alpine climb than it is a run. So I mean and that's sort of my background is more
[4172.60s -> 4177.08s]  Like kind of rock climbing and alpinism like I was a I was a climber way before
[4177.40s -> 4179.40s]  I was a runner. So like I
[4180.20s -> 4182.20s]  I like the hybridization
[4183.80s -> 4190.12s]  Of those sports of the running and the climbing and like that's really where I get off on. I really like those and
[4192.20s -> 4196.84s]  Which I think that's also recently been broken. Um, I think actually, yeah, I don't know
[4198.76s -> 4200.76s]  I think I think that's been broken as well
[4201.16s -> 4204.04s]  I think the only actually this is a sort of interesting story, too
[4204.12s -> 4206.28s]  I think the only record I still have that i'm like
[4207.00s -> 4212.20s]  Kind of proud of is a few years ago at born and maybe your listeners can correct me if i'm wrong
[4212.28s -> 4214.36s]  But I haven't heard of anyone that's broken it
[4214.92s -> 4218.60s]  But I actually ran a beer half marathon at the born to run race
[4219.88s -> 4220.84s]  um
[4220.84s -> 4226.28s]  And set the world record for that and I believe I still I believe I still have it
[4226.28s -> 4234.36s]  But again, maybe maybe your listeners know different a beer half marathon beer half marathon. Yeah, so that's a beer every mile
[4234.84s -> 4236.84s]  Oh my god
[4236.92s -> 4241.88s]  So same rules as the beer mile. No, um, you know if you puke you're out
[4242.12s -> 4244.92s]  Yeah, no, no shotgunning at least five percent
[4245.56s -> 4247.88s]  Patrick Sweeney beer mile rules and
[4248.84s -> 4255.16s]  I think I ran and again, I don't even know it. I think it was like 142 or something like that. Wow. Nice
[4256.36s -> 4260.52s]  So if if it if it's still if if that record still stands
[4261.40s -> 4264.52s]  again, the only record i'm probably proud of is that one but um
[4265.40s -> 4269.48s]  If that record still stands and this is an open challenge nice
[4270.12s -> 4271.32s]  I like it
[4271.32s -> 4276.20s]  Just be careful because I think the year Patrick Sweeney tried it. I think they had to take him to the hospital
[4278.44s -> 4283.96s]  Oh my god, i'm not even going to attempt it man, like no, thanks. That's not in my wheelhouse
[4285.00s -> 4286.76s]  um
[4286.76s -> 4292.76s]  You just real quick kind of a side note you mentioned with uh, the company you're sponsored with you're doing a write-up for them
[4293.08s -> 4298.84s]  Have you done writing in the past? I have yeah, I actually released a guidebook for a grand staircase
[4298.92s -> 4300.92s]  That's a couple years ago
[4302.28s -> 4307.64s]  And then i've had, you know a few random like publications here and there and I write a lot for myself
[4307.64s -> 4309.96s]  but it's definitely something that I
[4311.24s -> 4316.60s]  It's like kind of with running I I struggle with motivation and when when I am able to sit down and do it
[4316.60s -> 4322.68s]  I really enjoy it and I think I create a lot of content that I I I I personally enjoy and
[4323.64s -> 4324.44s]  I
[4324.52s -> 4330.60s]  I'm i'm hoping I can again. I I look for motivators, you know, and so I sort of use
[4332.04s -> 4339.48s]  Like satisfy really wants stuff for me, you know, so I use that as a motivator to actually sit down and pump some
[4340.68s -> 4342.76s]  Get some writing done. Yeah, and
[4343.48s -> 4348.36s]  I'm excited. I think it'll be cool. I think like I don't think very many people will read it or will care
[4348.52s -> 4350.12s]  but I think that
[4350.12s -> 4354.44s]  It'll be a race report like you've never seen before I think it's gonna be more like a
[4355.72s -> 4360.36s]  You know lord of the rings meets, you know the coca-dona meets like
[4361.48s -> 4365.40s]  Hunter s thompson and perfect, you know, it's gonna be a weird little thing
[4365.48s -> 4370.36s]  So and then there will probably be a podcast to accompany it or not. Sorry a playlist
[4370.84s -> 4378.36s]  Okay, do accompany it and just all the artwork i'm excited for and like that's what the satisfy guys are really good for
[4378.44s -> 4381.96s]  They're like super supportive of non-traditional things and
[4382.76s -> 4387.48s]  and stuff and they're okay with me being a social media idiot and just like
[4388.76s -> 4392.36s]  There's not a lot of expectation there other than like being
[4393.16s -> 4399.16s]  Being like genuine and and just like creating cool things together. So
[4399.80s -> 4403.16s]  which is really rare with sponsorships, you know, like I was sort of the
[4404.10s -> 4407.96s]  Antithesis of what a lot of like corporate athletes are
[4409.00s -> 4410.76s]  supposed to be
[4410.76s -> 4414.60s]  You know, like I think one of the coolest things about running is that you don't need anything
[4414.76s -> 4418.84s]  Like you go to the thrift store and buy a shitty pair of shoes and like go hit the trails like
[4419.80s -> 4426.12s]  so like that doesn't always jive super well when you're sponsored by some corporate entity, you know, but like
[4426.76s -> 4431.24s]  The satisfy guys are really cool and they're you know fun to work with and
[4432.20s -> 4436.84s]  They're just a different company for sort of the for you know for not just myself, but I think
[4437.56s -> 4440.20s]  and again, we did talk about this last time, but um
[4441.00s -> 4444.20s]  just the you know running being one of those like
[4445.16s -> 4449.08s]  The most pure forms of movement and pure sports out there
[4449.16s -> 4454.12s]  I think that there are a lot of people that run that don't fit that model of what like runners are supposed to be
[4454.28s -> 4456.28s]  or what they're supposed to look like and
[4457.08s -> 4458.36s]  um
[4458.36s -> 4464.20s]  You know, we're not all cute bubbly flowers and rainbows instagram models and like some of us, you know
[4466.28s -> 4471.88s]  Some of us are a little darker and rougher around the edges than that and um to satisfy guys are
[4472.42s -> 4478.92s]  Definitely that and i'm definitely that so it feels good to actually work with people who have a similar ethos and
[4480.12s -> 4485.08s]  We're interested in getting cool shit out there to people that will appreciate it. So yeah
[4485.80s -> 4487.80s]  well, I love the uh
[4488.12s -> 4490.12s]  I love what's behind it all like
[4490.44s -> 4494.28s]  You know, yeah, some of us aren't all cute and bubbly and instagrammy
[4494.36s -> 4499.24s]  But some of us are influenced by literature by art. Yeah punk rock music
[4499.64s -> 4506.68s]  Exactly. So that's a big reason why I work with satisfy. I mean they have a whole magazine they they they have like they they're very
[4507.88s -> 4515.16s]  Um involved in the culture and they love art and and music and their whole website is devoted to like art and music
[4515.32s -> 4517.16s]  and and interviewing
[4517.16s -> 4518.20s]  like
[4518.20s -> 4522.44s]  pretty like at least I consider very famous like of like
[4523.80s -> 4525.88s]  Doom metal like artists, you know
[4525.96s -> 4527.48s]  Or like or just like you know what I mean?
[4527.48s -> 4533.80s]  Like people that I really admire and like music like they interview they have and but they also always tie in running
[4533.88s -> 4540.12s]  Like so the the guy who runs the magazine actually is the founder of a record label called buddy head
[4540.52s -> 4543.64s]  That released a lot of like really influential punk music
[4544.60s -> 4549.08s]  Um from like when I was growing up a teenager like in the 90s in the 2000s
[4549.16s -> 4552.84s]  so now that's funny that i'm working with him like i'm getting a bunch of like
[4553.88s -> 4558.36s]  Kudos from my old high school friends who were like stoked that i'm like working with
[4558.92s -> 4561.40s]  The buddy head guy, you know and just like so
[4561.96s -> 4566.84s]  So there's just a lot of cool stuff that they do and I I mean anyone can go check out their website
[4567.00s -> 4572.44s]  they have you know, a lot of really really good interviews and playlists and just
[4573.72s -> 4578.36s]  Their their magazine is really it's possessed magazine. It's just a really cool thing and i'm
[4579.16s -> 4583.80s]  Again, i'm I don't work very well with most companies because i'm not you know
[4585.16s -> 4589.00s]  What a lot of companies need out of their athletes, but for somebody
[4589.96s -> 4596.04s]  For a company like satisfy like i'm sort of the perfect fit for them and um and vice versa. So yeah
[4596.44s -> 4597.32s]  Yeah, yeah
[4597.32s -> 4599.80s]  And now I will preface it by saying like yes
[4599.80s -> 4605.72s]  Their shit is really expensive and it's like but there's something to be said about making the nicest things
[4606.20s -> 4611.80s]  Yeah possible for running out of the most like out of the best materials they can possibly get
[4612.60s -> 4613.72s]  and like
[4613.72s -> 4619.56s]  I think like you sort of mentioned last time at a certain point when we I feel like get older and start to realize
[4619.56s -> 4621.56s]  we would rather have
[4621.64s -> 4627.08s]  Fewer high quality things in our life than than a lot of shitty things
[4627.80s -> 4628.92s]  Yeah
[4628.92s -> 4632.68s]  Yeah, I mean there's been points in my life where i'm mister frugal and you know
[4632.68s -> 4636.44s]  I'll find these running shorts on sale online. These are only 20 bucks
[4636.52s -> 4639.88s]  I'm making such a score, but you got to buy a new pair every year, you know
[4640.52s -> 4646.04s]  Well, that's like sort of my like I get like comments all the time because I have had sort of a history of like
[4646.34s -> 4649.00s]  sponsorships and support from different companies and
[4650.76s -> 4655.32s]  It's like half my closet it's like really expensive like nice shit that I got for free
[4655.40s -> 4657.72s]  And then the other half is all from the thrift store, right?
[4657.80s -> 4665.24s]  I'm either in like $300 windbreaker or just all like all used clothing from goodwill, you know
[4669.64s -> 4673.56s]  Well michael this is awesome man, I really appreciate you doing this for a second time
[4673.88s -> 4677.00s]  Thank you. Yeah. No, like I said, I think this was better. I think so too
[4677.40s -> 4681.56s]  Yeah, and the sound quality is a million times better. So maybe we should do it again
[4681.96s -> 4687.00s]  Totally i'd love to well i'm gonna keep an eye on you and the next time you go out and blow something else up
[4687.00s -> 4689.08s]  I'm gonna have you back on so just yeah
[4690.68s -> 4692.68s]  I will definitely do it because as
[4692.76s -> 4696.36s]  As you so eloquently eloquent. I didn't put that very eloquently
[4696.36s -> 4701.32s]  But as you so eloquently put at the beginning, uh, you're not a douchebag. Yeah, right
[4702.92s -> 4707.56s]  Cool. Well, let's leave it at that man. It was so perfect. Thanks a lot man
[4707.64s -> 4711.24s]  Have yourself a great night and talk to you soon brother. All right, i'll talk to you soon
[4711.24s -> 4713.24s]  Bye. Okay. Take care
