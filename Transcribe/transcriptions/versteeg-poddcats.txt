[0.00s -> 7.00s]  Welcome to the Everyday Ultra Podcast, a show designed to help you level up your training,
[7.00s -> 11.92s]  crush your races, and ultimately become a better endurance athlete every single day.
[11.92s -> 16.36s]  Whether you're an endurance athlete as a hobby or someone who wants to be the best in the
[16.36s -> 18.52s]  sport, this is the show for you.
[18.52s -> 21.64s]  I'm your host, Joe Corcion, and thank you so much for listening.
[21.64s -> 22.84s]  Now let's get into it.
[30.00s -> 38.72s]  What's up, everybody?
[38.72s -> 40.72s]  Welcome to another episode of the Everyday Ultra Podcast.
[40.72s -> 44.64s]  I'm your host, Joe Corcion, and I'm super excited to dive into this episode with you.
[44.64s -> 48.56s]  Before we get started, there's one thing that I always get questions on is what kind of
[48.56s -> 51.32s]  hydration gear do I need to run an ultra?
[51.32s -> 52.48s]  Do I need soft flasks?
[52.48s -> 53.48s]  Do I need handhelds?
[53.48s -> 54.64s]  Do I need bladders?
[54.64s -> 56.78s]  I always say it depends on the race that you're running.
[57.78s -> 60.02s]  If you're running a really fast race, then I would wear a handheld.
[60.02s -> 64.06s]  If you are running a really long race or a race where you're going to go a little slower,
[64.06s -> 68.54s]  then using a bladder or soft flasks with a pack is going to be the way to go.
[68.54s -> 72.38s]  But regardless of which hydration apparatus you're using in your training or your racing,
[72.38s -> 77.06s]  there is one brand of hydration equipment that I've been using in my training extensively
[77.06s -> 82.14s]  when it comes to handhelds and soft flasks and bladders that has just been so, so awesome
[82.14s -> 84.70s]  and very, very reliable because here's the reality.
[84.70s -> 88.86s]  I've tried many hydration products and sometimes they break, they leak, they're not great out
[88.86s -> 93.10s]  there and I've never had any of the problems with the products from Hydro Pak.
[93.10s -> 97.34s]  Now Hydro Pak is a company that designs handhelds, bladders, soft flasks, you name it when it
[97.34s -> 98.34s]  comes to hydration things.
[98.34s -> 101.64s]  They even have one of my favorite handhelds because they have one that actually straps
[101.64s -> 103.94s]  to your hand without you needing to grip it.
[103.94s -> 107.04s]  It's their new Sky Flask and it is absolutely incredible.
[107.04s -> 109.50s]  And they also have the best soft flasks in the game.
[109.50s -> 113.66s]  If you've ever used Solomon's running vest and the soft flasks that come with that vest,
[113.66s -> 117.26s]  that's actually created by Hydro Pak and they make their own soft flasks as well, which
[117.26s -> 120.02s]  can fit into any type of pack that you are using.
[120.02s -> 124.34s]  So if you're using a Nathan pack or if you're using a Solomon pack, they're going to be
[124.34s -> 126.28s]  able to fit into there as well.
[126.28s -> 129.86s]  So they're very versatile and the bladder is the same way as well.
[129.86s -> 134.22s]  These products, they don't leak, they're very reliable, they're durable and they are also
[134.22s -> 138.48s]  super, super comfortable to hold in your hand if you're using the handhelds and also they're
[138.48s -> 142.34s]  very light and they don't slosh around as much as any other products as well.
[142.38s -> 145.90s]  So when it comes to hydration equipment, Hydro Pak is the go to.
[145.90s -> 147.82s]  Plus they even have filters too.
[147.82s -> 151.70s]  So for if you're on a long hiking trip or maybe on a long run where you're going to
[151.70s -> 156.06s]  need to filter water, they have a filter where you can actually screw it on to your soft
[156.06s -> 159.70s]  flask or your handheld, scoop up some water and drink directly out of there and it will
[159.70s -> 163.10s]  filter all the bad stuff out of there so you can have reliable water.
[163.10s -> 167.14s]  So as you can see, the products by Hydro Pak are so amazing and because they are so amazing,
[167.14s -> 171.98s]  I want to give you a 20% discount off of any of Hydro Pak's products by using the code

[200.10s -> 202.42s]  Thank you so much for listening and let's get into the episode.
[211.14s -> 212.14s]  What's up everybody?
[212.14s -> 214.26s]  Welcome to another episode of the Everyday Ultra Podcast.
[214.26s -> 215.50s]  I'm your host, Joe Corzione.
[215.50s -> 220.46s]  And let me tell you, this is such an awesome episode as we are talking with Michael Verstieg.
[220.46s -> 227.34s]  Now, if you don't know who Michael Verstieg is, he is known as an Arizona legend and one of the legends in ultra running.
[227.38s -> 230.74s]  He has won the inaugural year of the Cocodona 250.
[230.74s -> 235.78s]  He had at one point the supported fastest known time for the Arizona Trail.
[235.78s -> 239.70s]  And he has been on the podium and has won multiple, multiple ultra races.
[239.70s -> 244.22s]  But what has been super cool is he has been this amazing figure in the ultra running world
[244.22s -> 249.10s]  that is known for his mystique and known for his elusive character that everybody knows
[249.10s -> 251.22s]  and loves in the ultra world itself.
[251.22s -> 257.18s]  And he's also a Satisfye pro athlete as well and just an awesome dude all around.
[257.26s -> 263.82s]  Now, in this episode, we talk with Michael Verstieg and we dive into his 100 mile race that he recently put on,
[263.82s -> 266.46s]  started to put on, I should say, the Saddles 100.
[266.46s -> 268.62s]  Last year, 2023 was the inaugural year.
[268.62s -> 270.22s]  He's doing it again this year.
[270.22s -> 276.86s]  And last year, the day before the race, I actually sat down with Michael to talk about the Saddles 100, all about the background.
[276.86s -> 279.90s]  And we also dive into a little bit of his personal life as well.
[279.90s -> 281.58s]  So this is a super exciting episode.
[281.58s -> 288.30s]  This episode was actually shot in conjunction for a documentary that's going to be coming out about Saddles 100 later this year
[288.30s -> 291.02s]  by my friends Ethan and David.
[291.02s -> 293.82s]  And so I'll be shouting out that documentary once it out.
[293.82s -> 299.10s]  But this is the full interview behind the scenes and all about the Saddles 100, all about Michael Verstieg,
[299.10s -> 305.58s]  and just all around fun conversation for anyone who's interested in the race or want to know what it's like to think about a race
[305.58s -> 310.54s]  or what makes just running in Prescott, Arizona so great from the man himself, Michael Verstieg.
[310.62s -> 314.86s]  All right. Let's dive into the episode with the legend himself, Michael Verstieg.
[315.66s -> 321.82s]  Well, Michael Verstieg, race director, Arizona legend, ultra runner, adventurer, musician.
[321.82s -> 323.34s]  So awesome to be chatting with you.
[324.38s -> 329.98s]  I think this race has gotten a lot of buzz and hype, and it's so exciting to see this all together.
[330.54s -> 337.10s]  But talk to me about before we dive into the race and everything, talk to me about the town and the city of Prescott, right?
[337.18s -> 344.46s]  Because we were kind of talking beforehand, this has been a place in Arizona that's kind of like this secret gem.
[345.10s -> 347.98s]  And it's so cool to see so many people from all around coming here.
[347.98s -> 352.30s]  So tell me about your connection to the area, why it's so special.
[352.30s -> 359.02s]  And for someone who's never heard of Prescott, like, what's the allure for it that brings this area together?
[360.46s -> 362.70s]  Yeah, I grew up here.
[362.70s -> 365.98s]  So, you know, I went to school here.
[365.98s -> 373.98s]  I've, you know, I've seen Prescott go through a lot of different phases and a lot of different things for better or for worse.
[373.98s -> 382.14s]  And it feels good to be like back living here and back doing, you know, bringing bringing.
[384.38s -> 394.30s]  Better events than I think this town has seen over the last 10, 15 years, like more outdoorsy and like sort of like low impact, sustainable events versus.
[395.02s -> 398.38s]  Again, like what this town usually gravitates towards lately, but.
[400.94s -> 401.98s]  Yeah, it's a cool place.
[401.98s -> 405.90s]  It's like, you know, the equestrian horse culture here has always been a thing.
[405.90s -> 412.38s]  I mean, you go downtown and get kind of inundated with that sort of kitschy Western thing, you know, which.
[414.78s -> 420.38s]  I've always liked sort of, you know, growing up here, you sort of like push back on that a little bit, but you also.
[420.54s -> 429.34s]  You know, as much as we like to pretend like we're all individuals and like, you know, super it's like we're all products of our upbringing in our environment.
[429.34s -> 432.86s]  And it's like I'm very much a product of Prescott and sort of that like.
[434.78s -> 440.78s]  Cowboy culture mixed with the like Prescott College, like dirt bag hippie kind of guy.
[440.78s -> 447.34s]  And yeah, so it's like it just feels good to like kind of bring a cool event to town.
[447.34s -> 451.82s]  And I think the name Saddles is like pretty good for that, too.
[451.82s -> 459.42s]  Like, you know, just like the geographical term Saddles, which is essentially what the route is, is just running Saddle to Saddle, but also like.
[460.62s -> 466.86s]  Again, not pushing back too hard, but sort of leaning into the Western thing and people can kind of take it however they want.
[466.86s -> 469.42s]  You know, it's like, yeah, so I don't know.
[469.42s -> 469.58s]  It's.
[471.98s -> 473.26s]  Yeah, we'll see how it goes.
[473.26s -> 474.22s]  That's awesome, man.
[474.22s -> 479.82s]  I love the connection of the name to like for the Saddles for the Western thing and also like the actual course itself.
[479.82s -> 481.50s]  It like speaks a lot to the race.
[481.50s -> 486.54s]  Yeah, and I mean, it's potential to like in years to come, we might open up a mountain bike option.
[486.54s -> 490.94s]  Oh, it's like, you know, it's what you call a seat on a mountain bike is a saddle.
[490.94s -> 491.58s]  So it's like.
[492.46s -> 493.42s]  So many meanings.
[493.42s -> 494.22s]  That's so cool.
[496.94s -> 497.58s]  That's amazing.
[497.58s -> 501.90s]  And for someone who hasn't like run on these trails before, like why are they so special?
[501.90s -> 502.70s]  What's super cool.
[502.70s -> 506.30s]  Like you've done, you know, Coco Dona, you've raised like all the three years, right?
[506.30s -> 507.42s]  The first year winning it.
[507.42s -> 508.38s]  It goes through Prescott.
[508.38s -> 510.70s]  Even the second year it started in Prescott.
[511.34s -> 514.54s]  Like you've been on these trails a lot and training and everything.
[514.54s -> 521.98s]  So what are these things in training or when you've been on these trails that are so special that you want people to get out when they're experiencing it?
[521.98s -> 527.42s]  I think Prescott more than I mean, I think Arizona in general, like whenever you talk about about.
[528.30s -> 533.50s]  Like outdoor anything with Arizona, like the word that's always used is like diversity, right?
[533.50s -> 537.82s]  So like Arizona has like more diversity than anywhere else.
[537.82s -> 541.34s]  It's like, and I think that that's magnified here in Prescott.
[543.18s -> 546.14s]  So like we don't have the best of anything.
[546.14s -> 546.78s]  You know what I mean?
[546.78s -> 550.94s]  Like, of course, like the mountains and Flagstaff are better than they are here or whatever.
[550.94s -> 554.94s]  It's like, but I mean, even on the saddles course, like the hundred mile, like you're
[554.94s -> 561.26s]  running through like spruce and fir, like montane, like up, up, up high around like seven, eight thousand feet.
[561.26s -> 569.74s]  And like the through the Ponderosa, like forest, like down into like the high desert of like Granite Basin and like.
[570.38s -> 579.18s]  Penny and Juniper and then like all the slick rock section out in the Dells, you run through like riparian areas and creeks and lakes.
[579.18s -> 584.38s]  And it's just like, you kind of hit a bunch of different terrains in a day.
[584.94s -> 588.86s]  You know, which is kind of which in my opinion is kind of cool.
[588.86s -> 593.42s]  You know, it's like, again, nothing against Flagstaff, like I love Flagstaff, you know, and it's like.
[594.22s -> 597.26s]  But, you know, you're running in the forest all day.
[597.26s -> 607.26s]  It's like, you know, and so, yeah, I just think that just the mix up the again, the diversity is kind of where it's at of the.
[607.98s -> 613.34s]  And it's nice training here and it's nice running here because like if you, you know, whatever mood you're in.
[613.50s -> 615.74s]  You can and you can run here every day of the year.
[615.74s -> 617.82s]  It's like, you know, at.
[618.70s -> 622.94s]  Winter time, you just run like out in the Dells because it's sunny and exposed and nice.
[622.94s -> 626.78s]  And it's like, so, yeah, it's good and it's a good elevation.
[626.78s -> 633.66s]  You know, Prescott's a mile high and it's kind of surrounded by like seven thousand feet hills, you know.
[633.66s -> 637.58s]  So, yeah, I think it's sort of perfect for all that.
[637.58s -> 639.10s]  And yeah.
[639.90s -> 640.70s]  Yeah.
[640.70s -> 646.70s]  Yeah. And that's so cool because a lot of people, when they think of Arizona, they think of like Flagstaff or like Phoenix.
[646.70s -> 649.90s]  But it's cool because like Prescott's like right in between or even Sedona, right?
[649.90s -> 651.10s]  But Prescott's right in between.
[651.10s -> 656.38s]  But you get the best of Flagstaff and you get like the best of Phoenix, all kind of in one area, which is cool.
[656.38s -> 663.82s]  Yeah. I mean, I think there's I think Prescott too, there's within I forget what it says, Amanda, the Hikeshack was actually just telling me it's like.
[664.54s -> 671.58s]  I think within like a 20 mile radius or something, there's over 500 miles of single track.
[671.58s -> 672.06s]  Oh, wow.
[672.06s -> 673.02s]  Trail. Yeah.
[674.06s -> 677.74s]  So like it was actually really hard to keep the course at only 100 miles.
[678.38s -> 682.86s]  It was like like I was constantly having to shave off and cut off and like.
[685.18s -> 691.26s]  So, yeah, it's like within city limits, which like we're on the border city, we're only 10 minutes from town, but we're like on the city.
[691.26s -> 695.82s]  Like within the city limits, there's over 200 miles of city of single track trail.
[696.38s -> 699.02s]  So it's like it's the sheer amount.
[699.02s -> 705.50s]  Like we have the city has a whole like Chris, his whole job is to like hire people and build trails.
[705.50s -> 708.30s]  And that's like that's those are like city positions.
[708.30s -> 711.34s]  So all they do is go around and build trails and number trails.
[711.90s -> 713.50s]  So like the city is very pro trail.
[713.50s -> 716.14s]  They're very pro like like pro event.
[716.14s -> 717.82s]  They've been great, like working with me.
[717.82s -> 727.50s]  And it's like, yeah, and I think that a lot of that stems actually like from the like equestrian history of Prescott.
[727.50s -> 732.62s]  So like the there's always been a shit ton of trails here because of the horses.
[732.62s -> 733.34s]  Right.
[733.34s -> 739.18s]  And like most of the main trails around here have are because of like equestrian clubs.
[740.22s -> 742.14s]  And then the mountain bike thing exploded.
[742.14s -> 745.02s]  And now there's just trails everywhere.
[745.02s -> 747.98s]  And I mean, it's it's I still go out.
[747.98s -> 752.14s]  I mean, like I said, I've lived here essentially my whole life, not consistently.
[752.14s -> 757.50s]  But it's like I can still go out and every if I wanted to like find trails I've never been on.
[757.50s -> 763.02s]  It's like because even beyond the like actual numbered official trails, there's so many social trails.
[763.02s -> 765.10s]  And it's like so it's just one of those things.
[765.10s -> 767.66s]  It's like it the trails are better.
[767.66s -> 768.94s]  There's more of them.
[768.94s -> 770.70s]  There's way less people.
[770.70s -> 774.94s]  It's like, you know, like Flagstaff, you know, again, I keep I feel like I'm
[774.94s -> 779.50s]  picking on Flagstaff for some reason, but it's like, yeah, people when it comes to like outdoor
[779.50s -> 785.90s]  sports kind of associate that with Flagstaff and I think people that know Prescott, like they know
[785.90s -> 789.34s]  that what's here and it's what what's great about it.
[789.34s -> 793.98s]  And but yeah, it's kind of how it's always been.
[793.98s -> 795.18s]  So that's awesome.
[795.18s -> 799.10s]  Now I feel like I need to come and run more in Prescott, like even all the trails that are there.
[799.10s -> 800.38s]  Like I didn't even know too much about it.
[800.38s -> 804.78s]  So it's cool that you're bringing awareness to like the trail culture here, which is
[804.78s -> 805.90s]  Well, the runners will see it.
[805.90s -> 810.86s]  I mean, it's actually one of the hard things about putting on this race is that every like every mile
[810.86s -> 811.66s]  there's a junction.
[812.54s -> 816.38s]  So like you're running through you're running this 100 mile course, but you're right in the middle
[816.38s -> 821.58s]  of this spider web network of trails that go in every direction, like every mile or two.
[822.22s -> 826.62s]  And so like that's why I'm making the runners carry the course on their phone because there's so many
[826.62s -> 832.70s]  junctions and they're all like, yeah, they all see activity, you know, so it's,
[832.94s -> 835.02s]  you know, there's a lot of trails here.
[835.02s -> 837.42s]  Oh, man, that's going to be awesome to see too.
[837.42s -> 841.02s]  And like it's like one of the things where runners are like, oh, wow, I'm going to have to like stay
[841.02s -> 841.82s]  focused navigating.
[841.82s -> 847.02s]  But is there like a hope that it like spurs people to come back not even just to the race, but just
[847.02s -> 849.66s]  to the town and like people to get inspired by that?
[849.66s -> 851.50s]  Like, is that like part of?
[851.50s -> 852.22s]  Yes and no.
[852.22s -> 857.58s]  I mean, I think big picture like for big like town concerns, the city.
[857.82s -> 864.94s]  Again, I think it's this town has a problem with sort of leaning into things that I don't really admire.
[864.94s -> 873.02s]  I think, you know, having more of these events happen and like supporting this culture, I think long term,
[873.02s -> 876.54s]  like clearly is a good thing.
[878.22s -> 884.70s]  Yeah, I mean, like selfishly, do I want all my trails and my climbing areas to be to be like for me and my
[885.58s -> 889.34s]  friends, you know, like, sure.
[889.34s -> 893.02s]  But it's also like, you know, this isn't Boulder.
[893.02s -> 898.06s]  It's like it's like there's there's there's plenty of space here for lots of people.
[899.82s -> 900.94s]  Yeah, I'd much rather see.
[900.94s -> 904.94s]  I mean, like, you know, this town has a weird kind of thing.
[904.94s -> 909.82s]  It's like we, you know, we can barely support a bouldering gym.
[910.30s -> 911.50s]  Mm hmm.
[911.50s -> 916.46s]  But meanwhile, there's like a dozen vape shops that are like fucking killing it, you know?
[916.46s -> 922.46s]  So it's like, I think that this town could use a little bit of like support and a little more
[924.06s -> 931.50s]  infrastructure and better things than, you know, vape shops and gun shops.
[931.50s -> 932.62s]  Yeah, for sure.
[932.62s -> 936.62s]  And what was super cool was last night, I was checking my hotel at like midnight, but
[937.26s -> 940.46s]  anyone who was checking in was here for the race, which was super cool.
[940.46s -> 942.06s]  And people are coming from all over.
[942.06s -> 944.54s]  So you're creating that environment, which is awesome.
[944.54s -> 949.10s]  Yeah, I think I think even I underestimate like even, you know, there's like 110 runners
[949.10s -> 953.18s]  or something, but even I underestimate the sort of impact that can have on a town,
[953.18s -> 958.46s]  no small town on a weekend because it's not just the runners, you know, it's it's spectators,
[958.46s -> 963.74s]  it's crew, it's family, it's wives, it's, you know, and so even this first year.
[964.22s -> 969.02s]  Yeah, I think it's a great thing for the town for sure.
[969.02s -> 969.18s]  Yeah.
[969.18s -> 970.46s]  And especially years to come.
[970.46s -> 977.02s]  I mean, I see this, I, you know, I do have a kind of my ear to the ground and obviously
[977.02s -> 981.02s]  being the race director, you know, and get a sense for certain things.
[981.02s -> 984.06s]  And I do think this race is going to blow up and it's like,
[986.14s -> 987.74s]  we'll do our best to manage that.
[987.74s -> 993.26s]  But I think that it's just going to be a great thing for Prescott.
[993.82s -> 995.10s]  Yeah, for sure. I totally agree.
[995.10s -> 999.82s]  And it's so cool to see like people like coming like just even if they're not racing,
[999.82s -> 1003.10s]  like knowing about it, talking about it, people like, oh, like I hear about the saddles race.
[1003.10s -> 1004.86s]  What is it? So you're building the buzz.
[1004.86s -> 1009.90s]  And what I loved is in the race manual, you said you're not well, the race manual is just
[1009.90s -> 1014.38s]  excellent all around. But the line that stood out to me the most is you said you're not
[1014.38s -> 1019.58s]  selling a product. You're creating an experience, which like I got chills when I was reading that.
[1019.58s -> 1022.14s]  What's that experience like you're trying to create?
[1022.94s -> 1027.26s]  I think sometimes I get a little like overly critical of things.
[1027.26s -> 1031.10s]  And, you know, I've been running ultras for a long time now.
[1031.10s -> 1035.42s]  And even in the like 10, 12 years that I've been in the sport, it's like,
[1037.18s -> 1042.06s]  you know, we all see the changes, we all see the growth, we see the sponsorship,
[1042.06s -> 1045.74s]  we see Hoka turning into whatever they are at this point.
[1045.74s -> 1051.26s]  You know, it's like we see Ultra going from this little Utah brand to whatever they've become.
[1051.50s -> 1063.02s]  It's like, Solomon, you know, it's just like, so races, and I understand how it happens.
[1063.02s -> 1069.82s]  I understand why it happens. But, you know, races, a lot of races at this point almost exist
[1070.46s -> 1075.66s]  as part of marketing departments for certain brands or certain, you know, and it's like,
[1076.14s -> 1085.42s]  which, you know, that is, it's like, that is like a musician's live show for a company like Solomon,
[1085.42s -> 1092.78s]  right? It's to like have a race push product, you know, banner, like, or it's like, it's just
[1092.78s -> 1097.82s]  so many of these races that I go to over the last like few years, it just feels like it's more about
[1097.82s -> 1104.46s]  the exploiting the market and like drawing out of the market versus contributing to it.
[1104.62s -> 1109.02s]  And so like, it just feels like, like, you know, the races that I've always loved or that like
[1109.02s -> 1114.78s]  stand out in my head that have always been really special to me are the races where it feels like
[1114.78s -> 1119.74s]  it's, it's a, you know, you can still have companies involved, like, like, there's nothing
[1119.74s -> 1124.54s]  wrong with that, you know, it's like, but it just feels like it's more of a contribution to
[1125.18s -> 1132.38s]  the culture and not not an extraction from and, and so many of these bigger races, like, you know,
[1132.38s -> 1138.54s]  don't know that I need to call any of them out by name, but it's, it just feels like it's more
[1138.54s -> 1143.10s]  about what they can sell the runners versus actually the experience of the run itself. And
[1143.10s -> 1148.22s]  so it's like just getting just for me, like any race, I mean, I can guarantee everyone involved,
[1148.22s -> 1152.46s]  any race that I'm a part of as far as a race director is like not going to feel like that. So
[1152.46s -> 1157.18s]  like, I mean, I like, sir, I had like companies reach out and want to be involved in saddles and
[1157.18s -> 1160.94s]  I was like, well, if you guys want to give stuff to the runners, I mean, I'm like, I'm like,
[1160.94s -> 1166.30s]  give stuff to the runners. Like runners love free shit. Like that's great. But other than that,
[1166.30s -> 1171.18s]  like this isn't going to feel like, like, I'm not pushing anything on you. Like that's not what this
[1171.18s -> 1177.98s]  race is about. This race is about coming out and like drawing a line in the sand and saying go.
[1177.98s -> 1182.94s]  And like, you know, they're glorified group runs, but, but in today's like kind of running culture,
[1182.94s -> 1190.30s]  you can't get, you can't get hundreds of people together unless it's a race, which, you know,
[1190.46s -> 1194.14s]  that's totally fine. You know, like I can post like, oh, let's go on a group run. And it's like,
[1194.14s -> 1199.02s]  well, but you know, it's just kind of a throwback to the original days of ultra running where it's
[1199.02s -> 1203.90s]  like, you know, even something like hard rock was just a group run for a while. And it's like,
[1206.22s -> 1212.94s]  so yeah, I mean, that's what it's all about. I mean, and I think runners, I think people
[1212.94s -> 1218.14s]  who signed up this inaugural year, like feel that. And that's, I think, I think the type of
[1218.14s -> 1224.30s]  person that signed up this year, you know, and again, I think that's why inaugural years are so
[1224.30s -> 1229.50s]  special at every race, you know, and like most typically my, my best memorandum races are always
[1229.50s -> 1233.82s]  inaugural. I mean, coca-dona, you know, and it's like, I mean, the second and third year, I mean,
[1233.82s -> 1241.42s]  I still think coca-dona is, is like the quintessential race, but it's, it's just different
[1241.42s -> 1246.70s]  second and third years. And you know, next year is going to be crazy. Yeah. I'm talking with Jamil,
[1247.10s -> 1253.26s]  and it's like, so I think being a part of this first year, it's going to be, you know,
[1254.14s -> 1259.02s]  I mean, we do that at coca-dona. Like when you run into other like first year coca-dona runners,
[1259.02s -> 1264.86s]  there's a little like, you know, like there's a head nod, you know, like we, you get it.
[1264.86s -> 1271.82s]  And it's just like, so yeah, I mean, I think this race will change, saddles will change,
[1271.82s -> 1277.74s]  you know, change is inevitable, but I've yet to decide how I'm going to allow that change,
[1277.74s -> 1285.90s]  whether that's a hard cap to keep it, keep it shitty or, you know, bringing in
[1287.98s -> 1294.14s]  people to help out, you know, probably going to be a hard cap. Yeah. And that's awesome. And
[1294.14s -> 1297.98s]  I'm excited to see how it evolves. And like the cool thing about this race, like you talk about
[1297.98s -> 1302.70s]  like creating this, you know, line in the sand and start and go, but this was a race that you
[1302.70s -> 1307.10s]  created because this is the race you want to run. So like people are getting the full Michael
[1307.10s -> 1311.34s]  Versteeg experience, which is cool. So like, obviously like, if I ask you like, what is your
[1311.34s -> 1315.74s]  ideal race, it will be saddles, but talk to me a little bit more, like what were the elements
[1316.38s -> 1321.98s]  that you said, yes, this is something that would be great for me that, you know, runners can
[1321.98s -> 1326.30s]  experience like being out there in saddles. Well, yeah, I think we've hit on a lot of that already,
[1326.30s -> 1331.10s]  just about, you know, the course and the terrain. But I mean, the biggest thing, I mean, because I,
[1331.98s -> 1338.38s]  this is my town. And so it's like, that's not to say that I can't design courses other places or,
[1338.38s -> 1348.38s]  you know, can't do that. But yeah, I mean, just it's my town. And I mean, even from very early on,
[1348.38s -> 1354.94s]  like I've been thinking about this race for a decade, because it's like this race, this course,
[1355.58s -> 1360.54s]  starting and ending downtown, like you can kind of see downtown for most of the course, like,
[1360.54s -> 1365.26s]  especially at night, like you can see all the city lights, because Prescott sits in this little basin
[1365.26s -> 1370.38s]  and the run essentially does a hundred mile loop, like kind of on the rim around town. Yeah. So you
[1370.38s -> 1377.18s]  can kind of like see town the whole time. And I just feel like it has all the elements to be like
[1377.18s -> 1383.50s]  the most classic hundred mile race in the country. Like, and I say that, you know,
[1385.66s -> 1390.62s]  not because it's not because of me, it's not because of satisfy, it's just because of the race.
[1390.62s -> 1399.66s]  And so because of all of that, like I've always known that, like it could be that. So I mean,
[1399.66s -> 1404.30s]  even like years ago where I was like, well, whether it's me or whether it's Jamil or whether it's
[1404.30s -> 1411.02s]  somebody like, whoever, whoever does that race is like, that's the race. You know what I mean? Like
[1411.02s -> 1416.06s]  that's the cool race. It's not, it's not a contrived route. It's not loops. It's not an
[1416.06s -> 1421.10s]  out and back. It's like you run two miles out of town and you do a 96 mile loop and you come back
[1421.10s -> 1427.26s]  down. And it's like, it's just, yeah, it's just, it's just all the things. And it's like, you know,
[1427.26s -> 1431.82s]  aid station, all the aid stations are super easily accessible, like crew accessible. There's cell
[1431.82s -> 1437.66s]  phone service at every aid station. There's like running into town down on the whiskey row on a
[1437.66s -> 1442.22s]  Saturday night at mile 99. And there's like hundreds of, you know,
[1445.82s -> 1453.10s]  altered adults. You know, it's just, it's just not to say that it will or that, you know,
[1453.10s -> 1456.86s]  or I don't know what it's going to become, but as far as like spectatorship, like,
[1458.62s -> 1464.54s]  you know, crewing participation, like it just has all the things like, like I actually, I'm actually
[1464.54s -> 1469.90s]  jealous of the people like volunteering and working the event because like that seems the
[1469.90s -> 1474.62s]  most fun. Like to be, to be totally honest, like at this race, because you're just, you're,
[1474.62s -> 1482.46s]  you're totally connected the whole time. And yeah, and I don't give a shit about like rules,
[1482.46s -> 1486.78s]  like, like, like if crew wants to like follow their runner around, like if they want to hop
[1486.78s -> 1491.82s]  in and run sections, like, you know, run with your dog, like I don't care about your fucking dog,
[1492.70s -> 1497.42s]  like, you know, it's a, it's like, I keep getting all these emails about like stuff and it's like,
[1497.42s -> 1501.42s]  I don't care. Like, why would I care about that? I don't know. So anyways,
[1503.74s -> 1509.50s]  yeah, like this race is like, no, like participate, participate with the town. Like if you see other
[1509.50s -> 1515.02s]  runners and they want to drink a beer with you on the trail, it's like, do it. Like there's no rules
[1515.02s -> 1519.98s]  like, like, like, that's another thing, like ultra runner, like, you know, like people like
[1519.98s -> 1525.02s]  Jamil was telling me how many emails he got from people calling to disqualify me that first year
[1525.02s -> 1530.62s]  at Cocodona. Because like one, I was on mushrooms like for the first day and then like two, I was
[1530.62s -> 1535.50s]  drinking beer with people. I was like meeting people out on the trail and like do it. And I like,
[1535.50s -> 1539.58s]  even like on downtown Flagstaff, I like gave my polls to my runner and it's just like,
[1539.58s -> 1546.06s]  God, all these fucking rules, you know, it's like, which I get if you're like UTMB, like this is not
[1546.14s -> 1552.54s]  UTMB. Like this is like, you know, this is not Leadville. Like, like, like,
[1553.82s -> 1558.46s]  embrace the community, like interact, talk to people. If somebody wants to like give you a
[1558.46s -> 1562.86s]  slice of watermelon and you're not at an aid station, like eat the fucking watermelon. It's like,
[1563.50s -> 1567.50s]  you know, like stop at the gas station, get a corn dog and a slushy. It's like,
[1568.46s -> 1572.30s]  do everything that you can, like be a part of the town, jump in the lakes,
[1573.26s -> 1578.06s]  you know, unintentionally, this course hits every lake in town. It's like Goldwater links,
[1578.06s -> 1582.14s]  like Watson, like Willow, like Granite Basin, like, like jump in the lakes, go swimming,
[1582.14s -> 1585.90s]  like do whatever, like go to Denny's and get some French toast. Like, I don't care.
[1586.70s -> 1592.86s]  It's like, do whatever you want. It's like, I mean, run the course, you know, run the right course.
[1592.86s -> 1596.70s]  But other than that, I don't care. It's like, you're bringing that group, like you were talking
[1596.70s -> 1599.82s]  about, it's almost like a big group run. You're bringing the group run element and marrying it
[1599.82s -> 1605.66s]  with that race aspect that brings everyone together. Because I think like the race aspect,
[1605.66s -> 1610.94s]  I agree with you can get too rigid and just hear the rules. Whereas like a group runs,
[1610.94s -> 1614.30s]  usually like, yeah, like fuck it. Let's just go out, have fun and drink beers.
[1614.30s -> 1618.14s]  It's also like with a hundred runners, like how many of those guys are like, you know,
[1619.10s -> 1623.26s]  yeah, I mean, if you're one of those guys that wants to take it super seriously, like go for it,
[1623.26s -> 1629.26s]  but you're like two or three guys or gals, you know, like everyone else is just out there to like,
[1629.26s -> 1633.42s]  for the experience and to do it. And that's like, that's what this race is geared to. Like,
[1633.42s -> 1642.30s]  I don't give a shit who wins saddles, like whatever great, like, you know, I mean, no,
[1642.30s -> 1646.06s]  I mean, I think it's, I think it's, I think it's cool if you win. Like, obviously that's a cool
[1646.06s -> 1652.30s]  thing. Like, like, but it's just like, everyone, everyone out there is doing the same thing,
[1652.30s -> 1658.06s]  you know? So it's like, yeah, dude, do, do it however you want to do it. If that's like running
[1658.06s -> 1664.94s]  it as hard as you can and like, and great. Yeah. Like it's not like meant to sell it
[1664.94s -> 1668.38s]  for hours. Like do whatever you want. Yeah. Like you're not trying to like sell it,
[1668.38s -> 1672.46s]  like make this a thing to like celebrate like high performance or winners. It's like celebrating
[1672.46s -> 1676.78s]  runners. Correct. I mean, I think you can do both. I mean, I think you can celebrate the winners and
[1676.78s -> 1685.34s]  say good job, you know, but, um, you know, this race is about this race and this course and this
[1685.34s -> 1692.78s]  experience. And that's a whole nother thing about like races. It seems like, like a lot of these
[1692.78s -> 1700.78s]  races these days are all about like, you show up and, and, and that race is, is about qualifying
[1700.78s -> 1707.58s]  for something else. Right. Like, like every race you show up to is like, oh, well I'm here to qualify
[1707.58s -> 1714.22s]  for this race. I'm here to do that. Like it's very rare that people are actually showing up for a race,
[1714.22s -> 1722.62s]  like for that race. And it's like, this race is not a qualifier for any other race. Like, like,
[1722.62s -> 1728.54s]  like if you run saddles, you're here to run saddles. Like, like I'm not going to get on my
[1728.54s -> 1736.14s]  knees for UTMB to like try and make my race to get like, like, like this race is never going to
[1736.14s -> 1743.10s]  have stones, whatever the fuck stones are, you know, it's like, it's like, uh, like,
[1744.54s -> 1749.90s]  and there's not a qualifier for this race. Like I don't like, I'll never require you to like run
[1749.90s -> 1754.62s]  one of my other races to get into this, right? You know what I mean? It's like, no, this race
[1754.62s -> 1760.22s]  is about this race. Like if you're running saddles, this is what you're here for. You're not here to
[1760.22s -> 1766.62s]  qualify for some other run down the line, like experience fucking today, man. So it's like,
[1768.22s -> 1777.50s]  so that, that, that, that's a big thing about saddles is like, like you're sad. That's what,
[1777.50s -> 1781.42s]  that's what we're doing. We're doing saddles. We're not doing another race, you know.
[1820.22s -> 1824.94s]  Shirts, jackets, and more all built to explore the world on the run. Not only do they have a
[1824.94s -> 1829.18s]  five-year guarantee where they will replace any product that wears away, but their stuff is super
[1829.18s -> 1832.86s]  comfortable, breathable, and easy to move in, especially in the winter months when you're
[1832.86s -> 1839.02s]  bundled up a ton. Plus 2% of their sales go towards nonprofits working on viable clean water solutions.
[1839.02s -> 1843.10s]  So it's a way to give back and feel good about where your money is going. They have super bright
[1843.10s -> 1847.50s]  colors and artwork designed by talented artists all across the world. So you'll stand out on the
[1847.50s -> 1851.42s]  trail, which is, like I said, one of the most important things. My favorite products have been
[1851.42s -> 1855.58s]  the Transit TechShort and the Run All Day Tee. I like the Transit Shorts because they're lightweight,
[1855.58s -> 1859.18s]  easy to move on my runs, especially when I'm climbing hills or doing faster efforts,
[1859.18s -> 1863.50s]  because they don't have a liner. And when you don't have a liner, I feel like you can move around a
[1863.50s -> 1867.66s]  lot, lot better when it comes to doing these faster efforts on the trail. And I love the
[1867.66s -> 1871.58s]  Run All Day Tee because it feels like you're barely wearing anything out there, which keeps
[1871.58s -> 1875.74s]  you really, really cool on a hot day and doesn't feel like you're overwhelmed on a cold day as
[1875.74s -> 1880.22s]  well. So it feels like you're not wearing anything that's holding you down. So I 100% suggest you try
[1880.22s -> 1884.38s]  out John G's clothing. And if you're looking to test drive it, you can get 10% off your order.

[1904.78s -> 1912.62s]  here. So good. I got chills when you're saying that because so many times, and I'm guilty of it,
[1912.62s -> 1916.06s]  too. I'm not saying I'm like perfect, but it's like, I'm doing this race to qualify for Western
[1916.06s -> 1920.54s]  or UTMB, but it's like, you're not doing the race just to do it. You're doing it to just check a box,
[1920.54s -> 1926.30s]  which- You're like even fucking Leadville. Like, God, dude, I don't want to run one of your other
[1926.30s -> 1932.46s]  shitty races to get into your race. If I want to run Leadville, that's the race I want to run.
[1933.42s -> 1939.42s]  It's just shitty. It's like business. It's like, oh, well, you have to run UTMB. You have to run
[1941.74s -> 1948.14s]  two to three of our other races and give us money to even be able to qualify for our big race. And
[1948.14s -> 1952.22s]  it's like, well, I don't want to run your shitty other races. I just want to run UTMB. It's like,
[1954.14s -> 1955.98s]  I don't know. I think I've said enough about that.
[1955.98s -> 1961.42s]  No, that's great, man. No, but I love it because it's like returning to the integrity of the actual
[1961.42s -> 1966.62s]  race itself and you get people who are present. I think you touched on that word presence is so,
[1966.62s -> 1971.58s]  so important, especially in a world where there's notifications and internet and pings. And it's
[1971.58s -> 1977.82s]  like, sometimes we can lose that essence of being present. And I think even just that essence of
[1977.82s -> 1983.82s]  doing the race to do the race brings that back to the experience, which is something that I feel like
[1983.82s -> 1990.46s]  can be so easily removed in this commercialized and digitalized world. You kind of bring back to
[1990.46s -> 1996.06s]  the roots of what life's experience is. Yeah, which is like kind of silly that we need to
[1996.06s -> 2002.06s]  do that, right? But it's like, oh, thanks. Slav.
[2006.46s -> 2012.94s]  Yeah, I love that, man. And what's interesting too is I love how this is the dream race for you.
[2012.94s -> 2017.82s]  It's kind of bringing in the elements, all of you too. But the cool thing is you've had this idea
[2017.82s -> 2023.42s]  for like 10 years, which is so awesome. And I think so many people who are in the ultra world
[2023.42s -> 2030.14s]  are like, I would love to have this race. Why did you decide to put it into action? Because I think
[2030.14s -> 2033.98s]  almost you ask anyone in the ultra community, they can probably say, yeah, I'd love to put on a race,
[2033.98s -> 2040.46s]  but far and few between, execute on it. So what? Well, I think it was actually Satisfye. I think
[2040.46s -> 2051.18s]  Satisfye were the ones that were the ones that sort of instigated like the pushing me to actually
[2051.18s -> 2056.22s]  do it versus just talk about it. And I think just like having that sort of support and knowing that
[2056.22s -> 2063.66s]  support would be there. Yeah. Also just like sort of feeling like I'm an aging ultra runner and like,
[2064.22s -> 2069.98s]  you know, how long I'm really going to participate in the sport in like a competitive manner or like
[2070.30s -> 2080.14s]  not a competitive manner, but just like, just like sort of whatever I've done in ultra, like how long
[2080.14s -> 2085.02s]  I'm going to like continue to do that and like still wanting to be a part of like ultra running
[2085.02s -> 2090.30s]  in whatever way. And, you know, I think that's a trope a little bit of like the aging ultra runner,
[2090.30s -> 2095.10s]  like moving into the race directing thing. And so there was a little bit of that, I think.
[2096.06s -> 2101.74s]  But also I just like, I didn't see it happening. And if I did see it happening, it wasn't exactly
[2101.74s -> 2112.86s]  how I thought it should be, you know? And I think that, you know, for a long time, I've been sort of
[2112.86s -> 2120.70s]  Prescott's like resident ultra runner, you know? And I felt like I was, if it was going to be done,
[2121.18s -> 2129.10s]  and if it was going to be done right, like, I think it makes sense that I'm the one doing it for,
[2129.10s -> 2133.82s]  if I can like set humility aside for a second and say that, you know what I mean? It's like,
[2134.54s -> 2141.34s]  it just like, it just like, it feels like I should be the one to do it. I don't know how to say it.
[2141.34s -> 2146.94s]  It's like, if there's a 100 mile classic ultra in Prescott, Arizona, like that should be me.
[2147.58s -> 2153.34s]  And again, I feel like that's like kind of maybe a cocky thing to say. Like, it feels weird to say
[2153.34s -> 2159.34s]  that a little bit, but it's like, there was just, there's just a part of that, that felt that way.
[2159.34s -> 2167.90s]  So yeah, for better or for worse, to be honest, because I'm not a good race director. I mean,
[2167.90s -> 2172.78s]  I think I'm a good like wealth of resources. I know a lot of people and I have a lot of connections
[2173.34s -> 2181.02s]  and I've brought in a lot of people to help even behind the scenes. Like I work for a race company
[2181.02s -> 2185.50s]  in Utah, you know, like I'm, you know, I'm obviously close and friends with Aerovipa and
[2185.50s -> 2191.98s]  they're both like shadow supporting this event like crazy for no gain of their own.
[2193.10s -> 2198.86s]  You know, both Vacation Races and Aerovipa are supporting this event.
[2198.86s -> 2199.26s]  Wow.
[2199.26s -> 2199.98s]  Heavily.
[2199.98s -> 2200.86s]  That's so cool.
[2200.86s -> 2205.74s]  And no one knows that and they're not advertising it. It's through no gain of their own. They just
[2205.74s -> 2211.66s]  want to see this event succeed and they want to see me succeed. And it's like, it's and so,
[2211.66s -> 2216.38s]  and Satisfy, you know what I mean? Satisfy taking over so many of the things and making it special
[2216.38s -> 2221.02s]  like Satisfy does and making it unique and making it different and making it cool. Like,
[2222.54s -> 2229.26s]  so again, I'm not good at any of that. You know what I mean? But like, I am good at bringing all
[2229.26s -> 2236.94s]  those people together and making this event a super cool event. And so yeah, it's like,
[2238.14s -> 2239.74s]  I don't remember what the question was.
[2239.74s -> 2244.70s]  Oh, no, but it was no, I think it was we were talking about like why you put it into action,
[2244.70s -> 2249.42s]  but I love and I totally 100% agree with you. I think if there was someone to put on this race,
[2249.42s -> 2253.82s]  it would be you. And like the cool thing, I know you mentioned earlier, like the race isn't about
[2253.82s -> 2260.62s]  you, but you have drawn so many people to experience like not only Sal's 100, but Michael
[2260.62s -> 2268.86s]  Versteeg's race. Like that's a draw. I think using sort of my reputation as a way to like,
[2271.98s -> 2278.06s]  again, I don't know how like this first year the race is going to be a successful event.
[2278.06s -> 2283.58s]  For sure. You know, and not that many races have that first year.
[2284.14s -> 2291.98s]  Usually that takes a few years to build that up. And I think that has to do with, you know,
[2292.54s -> 2297.34s]  the fact that I'm able to exploit my reputation as an ultra runner and like sort of, you know,
[2297.98s -> 2302.14s]  and all like all of us ultra runners, like, you know, we all know each other. So it's like,
[2302.14s -> 2308.86s]  it's not like some random like Ironman dude coming in, like trying to put on 100 mile race. It's like,
[2309.82s -> 2315.10s]  I know everybody. So it's like, I can invite all my friends who are ultra runners, like come run
[2315.10s -> 2321.02s]  the race, you know, you know, and it's like, I know all these people that work at all these companies.
[2321.02s -> 2326.54s]  And it's like, you know, if I need support for something, it's like, I just ask and they're like,
[2326.54s -> 2332.14s]  yeah, of course. And it's like, it's just so it's, I think I've been able to turn my success as an
[2332.14s -> 2336.86s]  ultra runner into an successful event because of those things. I'm just being that sort of
[2337.58s -> 2341.66s]  plugged in, you know, and yeah.
[2341.66s -> 2348.70s]  Yeah. And it creates a good impact. I mean, it just shows like the contribution you've had
[2348.70s -> 2352.86s]  to the ultra running world. I mean, like, I know just being local in Arizona, like I've
[2352.86s -> 2356.62s]  taken a lot of inspiration from you, like even David and I were talking, like he was
[2356.62s -> 2360.38s]  talking about how inspiring you've been. And I know that's been like a thing for runners. And so
[2360.38s -> 2365.58s]  to see like people wanting to come in and help and wanting to participate in the race,
[2365.58s -> 2370.86s]  like shows, you know, your impact on the community, which is like super cool to see
[2370.86s -> 2374.62s]  that kind of all coming together tomorrow for the hundred mile race, which is special.
[2374.62s -> 2379.98s]  Yeah. I mean, I think there's just a huge part of, of ultra running and running in general that
[2379.98s -> 2387.10s]  doesn't fit that sort of like classic mold of, of training or what a runner is supposed to look like
[2387.10s -> 2391.58s]  or what a runner is supposed to be. You know, like I still cringe when people call me an athlete,
[2391.58s -> 2396.30s]  you know, like I grew up my whole life, like in bands and skateboarding and like,
[2396.30s -> 2400.62s]  I don't really associate myself as like your prototypical athlete. And so it's like,
[2402.06s -> 2405.90s]  you know, I didn't run in college. I didn't run in high school. It's like, like, like,
[2405.90s -> 2410.62s]  and so there's just, and I say all of that to say that there's just like, there's a huge market out
[2410.62s -> 2414.30s]  there and are not market. I don't want to use that word. There's, there's just like, there's
[2414.94s -> 2422.86s]  so many of us don't identify with sort of the like typical runner, like Nike trail runner,
[2422.86s -> 2431.74s]  you know what I mean? It's like, like, um, and I think that, I think that's why I've had some
[2431.74s -> 2439.98s]  success is because like people have kind of identify that in me as like, I don't necessarily
[2440.62s -> 2445.10s]  represent a lot of the same things that other, other, you know, professional athletes do. And,
[2447.98s -> 2454.94s]  and like, you can be anything you can, you know, you can look however you want, you can do anything,
[2454.94s -> 2460.30s]  like, you know, you don't, it's a great thing about ultra running is like, you don't need
[2460.30s -> 2463.98s]  anything, like go to the thrift store and buy a shitty pair of shorts and shoes and like go
[2463.98s -> 2468.86s]  running. And it's just like, and so that all these reasons where it's just like,
[2470.70s -> 2475.90s]  I think because of those same things that people identify in me as just an ultra runner, I think
[2475.90s -> 2481.10s]  that they realize I'm going to bring that to my race. And it's like, it's, it's going to feel like
[2481.10s -> 2485.58s]  that. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know why like that feeling and that aesthetic is so
[2485.58s -> 2491.58s]  important, but it is right. It's like, that's all. And I mean, I mean, 99% of running a hundred
[2491.58s -> 2498.38s]  miles is actually just running the a hundred miles, but that other 1% of like feeling and
[2498.38s -> 2505.10s]  community and like intent, I don't know why like intent matters, right? So like, you know,
[2505.74s -> 2510.30s]  and it's like what you said about the race manual, the intent here is the experience.
[2510.30s -> 2516.78s]  So, you know, take that for what it's worth, but yeah.
[2517.58s -> 2521.66s]  Yeah. That's awesome, man. I love that. And I think that's what draws people is they want that.
[2521.66s -> 2525.66s]  And again, like in a world where everything's getting so noisy and everything is just a stepping
[2525.66s -> 2531.02s]  stone pun, totally intended for the next thing. Like it's, I think people want to experience that.
[2531.02s -> 2535.18s]  And that's why you're seeing a hundred people coming in and racing this race and wanting to be
[2535.18s -> 2539.26s]  a part of it. And even just thinking about it next year, which is super, super cool to see.
[2539.26s -> 2543.66s]  Well, I think too, with races, we get it, we get like focused in on this thing and like,
[2544.14s -> 2548.78s]  like there was a lot of pressure for me, like the number of emails I got and requests I got to like
[2548.78s -> 2558.70s]  open a 50 K. Oh, interesting. You know, and it's like, we'll just run 50 K. Like stop the 50 K.
[2558.70s -> 2563.34s]  Like do whatever you want or like, or like so many people, like I have a lot of like friends,
[2563.34s -> 2568.78s]  local runners in town that like, you know, don't want to like, they don't know if they can run
[2568.78s -> 2572.30s]  50 miles or they don't know if they can run a hundred miles. And it's like, well, don't
[2573.90s -> 2579.66s]  show up and run whatever you want. Show up and run mile 40 through 60, you know,
[2579.66s -> 2584.94s]  and like, we'll give you a ride back. It's like, it doesn't like, like we get so caught up in like
[2584.94s -> 2590.14s]  the rules and like the rigidness around races about like, again, going back to what we were
[2590.14s -> 2595.26s]  saying about following all the rules, but like, yes, there's a 50 and a hundred mile, but that's
[2595.26s -> 2600.86s]  just for like sake of, of like, I have to have an ultra sign up page and like, I have to click
[2600.86s -> 2606.70s]  distances, you know what I mean? But like show up and do whatever you want. Like show up and run 20
[2606.70s -> 2612.38s]  miles on Saturday and then go to sleep and then go do the 80 through a hundred on Sunday. Like,
[2612.38s -> 2618.22s]  I don't care. Like, like, like this experience is whatever you want to make it. Like yes,
[2618.22s -> 2623.10s]  we'll have the race stuff. Yes, we'll have the a hundred mile and like, we'll have all the things
[2623.10s -> 2628.14s]  and we'll give you your finisher thing or whatever, you know, and your t-shirt and a high five and
[2630.86s -> 2639.58s]  like, do whatever you want. Like, like this, the saddles is not my, I can't tell you what saddles
[2639.58s -> 2645.18s]  is. Like I can't, I can't force anything on you, but you can do whatever you want. And so it's like
[2645.18s -> 2650.78s]  that, that's what I envision is like a few hundred people showing up and like running what they want
[2650.78s -> 2659.18s]  to run and like, yeah. I love that man. That is so awesome. I might have to hop on the course
[2659.18s -> 2667.34s]  tomorrow. Now you can all run, like run it, run 10 miles, like run the first 10 miles or run the
[2667.34s -> 2672.62s]  last 10 miles, run the last 10 miles. Cause it's like you run into town. Super cool. It's like
[2672.62s -> 2676.06s]  people, I like, I keep getting questions like that are like, Oh, I was thinking about running
[2676.06s -> 2682.54s]  the last mile like through town and my runner like, is that okay? Yes, that's okay. It'd be totally
[2682.54s -> 2692.30s]  fine. Like, yeah, you know, maybe don't like invite 20 people and like chow down on my aid
[2692.30s -> 2697.66s]  stations, but you know what I mean? But it's like, other than that, it's like, yeah. Oh,
[2701.34s -> 2705.58s]  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Tell us a little bit. We were talking so much about the race, but yeah,
[2705.58s -> 2709.18s]  like about to round it out with how you got into ultra running your background.
[2709.18s -> 2716.78s]  Yeah. I think we got like 10 minutes. Yeah. How I got into ultra running. I was, I've always been,
[2716.78s -> 2724.78s]  I've always been sort of an outdoorsy guy and you know, I was way more into like kind of the
[2724.78s -> 2730.46s]  mountaineering side of climbing mountains and just rock climbing. Like I've been a rock climber a lot
[2730.46s -> 2736.30s]  longer than I've been a runner. And so even with like a lot of my climbing stuff, whether it be
[2736.30s -> 2741.34s]  like, let's say like the Grand Teton is a great example where it's like, yes, you can like climb
[2741.34s -> 2746.14s]  that and like expedition style, but you can also just run up and down it. It's like not that big of
[2746.14s -> 2752.78s]  a deal. So like, I like even in my, even in those days before I was like a quote unquote runner,
[2752.78s -> 2760.22s]  I always sort of gravitated towards just like, you know, just going light and fast and doing stuff
[2760.38s -> 2767.18s]  that way. So I wasn't, so when I started ultra running or when I started running, I guess was
[2769.02s -> 2779.18s]  like 2012, I say, and I want to say I went on like my first like run, you know, ever. And then that
[2779.18s -> 2785.74s]  same year I like ran the stage coach 100. So I like, I like, so again, but it wasn't like I was
[2785.74s -> 2793.82s]  like out of shape. It wasn't like I was one of these people who like, you know, that had to
[2795.34s -> 2801.34s]  do that. It was like, I was very fit and already kind of doing that. I just wouldn't, I just wasn't
[2801.34s -> 2807.74s]  calling it running before that. So my background is very much like the mountain sports kind of like
[2807.74s -> 2812.06s]  evolving into trail running type of thing. And then like, he started running and you're like,
[2812.06s -> 2819.10s]  oh yeah, like, let's go do a 50 K at a race. And it's like, oh, you like do pretty well at the 50 K.
[2819.10s -> 2823.26s]  And then you're like, you do another race and it's like, oh, I won the race. And then it's like,
[2823.26s -> 2829.26s]  oh, I'm like pretty good at this. And it's like, I think you grab it. I think human beings gravitate
[2829.26s -> 2834.94s]  towards things that they're good at, right? And like, it feels good. It's like, and then you start
[2834.94s -> 2839.50s]  like getting attention for things and then you sponsor, but, you know, and it just sort of,
[2839.50s -> 2845.74s]  it just sort of like snowballs and it's like, oh, like I'm an ultra run, you know, or whatever.
[2845.74s -> 2850.78s]  And then like, especially for people that don't know me, like, like that's like people that only
[2850.78s -> 2857.34s]  so like know me from online, like Instagram or something like that. Like I, I don't use
[2857.34s -> 2862.54s]  Instagram for my personal life. Like I don't ever share anything about my personal life online. Like
[2863.34s -> 2870.46s]  like I, I have those things because of contractual obligations, you know what I mean?
[2870.46s -> 2875.74s]  Essentially. And so like my, and so like people, even though like ultra running and trail running
[2875.74s -> 2881.90s]  is like a thing that I do, I don't really identify that way. It's like, I do a lot of things and
[2881.90s -> 2888.14s]  like, it's, it's certainly something that I do. Well, well, that's not really fair. I mean, it's
[2888.14s -> 2891.42s]  also how I kind of make a living, but it's like, but it's like,
[2894.86s -> 2901.98s]  that's all I ever talk about on social media. So it's like, so I understand people identifying
[2901.98s -> 2907.98s]  me as like a trail runner, an ultra runner, and it's like, which is totally fine. No problems with
[2907.98s -> 2914.14s]  that at all. But it's like, yeah, it's, it's, it evolved out of the sort of, and I feel like that's
[2914.14s -> 2920.38s]  true of like a lot of, of ultra runners. Like there's sort of at this point in American ultra
[2920.38s -> 2926.22s]  running, at least there's sort of two backgrounds. There's either like the mountain sports background
[2926.22s -> 2931.66s]  or there's like the college running, like the real athletes. You know what I mean? And it seems like
[2931.66s -> 2939.74s]  as the sports evolving, those like dirt bag sort of mountain sport athletes are like, like the days
[2939.74s -> 2945.18s]  are showing up and winning races as like this, like dirt bag trail runners are sort of going away.
[2945.18s -> 2950.22s]  Yeah. But there's still, there's still a market for it a little bit. It's like you can,
[2953.42s -> 2958.38s]  you know, I feel like we're like guys like me are sort of gravitating towards like the longer stuff
[2958.38s -> 2963.26s]  because those college kids don't want to run the longer stuff. Like, like, like I'm not ever going
[2963.26s -> 2971.18s]  to like show up to, well, you know, I don't know any of those fast rates. Like I'm never ever going
[2971.18s -> 2977.82s]  to show up to Lake Sonoma and like compete. Like that's not my game. Yeah. If you want to run through
[2977.82s -> 2983.10s]  three days for the desert, you know, there's still like, there's still a little like niche for us a
[2983.10s -> 2988.46s]  little bit, but I don't know what I'm talking about. No, that was great, man. That was great. And I
[2988.46s -> 2993.66s]  guess like to cap it all off, like you mentioned not being like, like there's more in this, right?
[2993.66s -> 2998.46s]  Cause I've been swearing a lot. Oh yeah. Just, yeah. Dude, fuck. Yeah. But for, for the last kind of
[2998.46s -> 3004.46s]  thing to round it out, what is something about like Michael Versteg that people maybe don't know,
[3005.18s -> 3011.18s]  like that really defines you, but maybe isn't as well known to the people who follow you along on
[3012.14s -> 3017.58s]  social and the internet and everything. Yeah. I feel like that's, it's funny because I've brought
[3017.58s -> 3022.14s]  up the social media thing to satisfy cause I'm awful at social media, right? Like I'm just bad
[3022.14s -> 3028.38s]  at like, I don't share, I don't do things. And it's like, so I've brought that up to satisfy about
[3028.38s -> 3033.58s]  like, Hey, like, do you guys want to take this over? Like, do we need to hire somebody that are
[3033.58s -> 3042.94s]  constantly just like, no, like you're good. And I think, I think the not posting stuff and not
[3042.94s -> 3047.58s]  sharing stuff, I think there's an allure there that like satisfies trying to tap into, but at
[3047.58s -> 3053.26s]  least for like me and my wife, like when we talk about it, it's like, well, if people actually knew
[3053.26s -> 3060.54s]  like how I was like, like, like the reputation that I have versus is like who I am, like,
[3060.54s -> 3065.26s]  you know, like, cause you want to know what I think about all day. Like I fantasize about being
[3065.26s -> 3071.02s]  on the enterprise with, with like Jordy LaForge and data and like being in the engineering
[3071.02s -> 3077.10s]  department and like figuring shit out. Like that's what I fantasize about or, or the, the fact that
[3077.10s -> 3084.06s]  like, you know, like I'm reading the Silmarillion for like the third time, you know, or like things
[3084.06s -> 3089.74s]  like that, or like I'm obsessed with Lord of the Rings or like, cause I'm actually a dork, dude.
[3089.74s -> 3096.62s]  Like, like, like, like, so I think satisfies like, no, you don't need to share stuff.
[3096.62s -> 3103.50s]  Yeah. Just let people keep thinking that you're like whatever people think you are or whatever.
[3106.38s -> 3111.66s]  But yeah, I'm also like, you know, fairly domesticated in my life at this point. Like
[3111.66s -> 3115.90s]  I have a house. I just have, I just had a baby. I have a three month old baby.
[3115.90s -> 3119.34s]  Congrats. Oh my gosh. It's awesome. She's in the house right now. It's like,
[3120.14s -> 3123.02s]  I have a family and dogs and a house and
[3125.10s -> 3132.38s]  that sort of wild roaming man that I've maybe once was in my life is pretty much over with. And
[3133.58s -> 3138.54s]  I mean, I still do plenty of stuff, but it's just like, yeah, like I don't think, and you know,
[3139.82s -> 3144.54s]  why would anyone know about my personal life? Like I don't share details with anybody. So
[3145.50s -> 3149.82s]  um, but yeah, I think that's a big misconception about me.
[3152.22s -> 3156.38s]  They think it's like all about running, but it's so much more. It's Lord of the Rings and family and,
[3156.38s -> 3161.98s]  and you know, being like someone just beyond just the runner, it's the whole person. And what's
[3161.98s -> 3165.42s]  super cool is like, I feel like with saddles, that's what you're trying to also like encapsulate.
[3165.42s -> 3169.10s]  It's like, sure. It's about the running experience, but it's about presence. It's about intent. Like
[3169.10s -> 3173.82s]  you said, it's about life. And I think that's what's drawn people to it. With the fires,
[3174.54s -> 3180.46s]  uh, so the forest service lit the first 10 miles of my course on fire a few days ago.
[3180.46s -> 3185.82s]  Oh geez. So we've been dealing with that, but I was like, yeah, I'm just going to tell all the
[3185.82s -> 3191.02s]  runners to like, just pretend like it's like the last flight of Frodo through Mordor climbing
[3191.02s -> 3198.46s]  Mount Doom. It's like, uh, like, yeah, that'll be fine. So epic. Oh, wow. That is awesome. That is
[3198.46s -> 3202.38s]  awesome. Well, Michael, this is great, man. Appreciate you. This is best wishes for this
[3202.38s -> 3206.22s]  weekend. It's going to be amazing. Sorry for swearing so much. I'm an awful person.
