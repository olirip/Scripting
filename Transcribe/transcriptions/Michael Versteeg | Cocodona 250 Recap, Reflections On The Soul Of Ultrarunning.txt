[0.00s -> 6.00s]  was like if this was gonna be on YouTube or not and if I needed to like get dressed but I did put
[6.00s -> 12.24s]  a shirt on so I think that's I think we pass all the YouTube requirements if we do that um yeah I
[12.24s -> 16.72s]  think we will just because there is there are some people that for whatever reason uh watch
[16.72s -> 22.64s]  these things I don't know why I could never do it but some do so we put it there um the first
[22.64s -> 29.36s]  place I want to get into this with you is I guess it's a couple years old so it's kind
[29.36s -> 35.76s]  of out of date but I just came across it your your race report from the 2021 coca-dona it's titled
[36.32s -> 43.04s]  what a time to not be unalive a not so appropriate musing on the coca-dona 250 and after reading it
[43.04s -> 47.60s]  it I was trying to like make sense of it and it's like hunter s thompson meets lord of the
[47.60s -> 52.00s]  rings meets ultra running and there were some amazing bits in there why did you choose the
[52.00s -> 58.08s]  style you did uh I actually don't know that it was that intentional I just felt like it was
[58.08s -> 63.12s]  that you know I don't I don't write race reports I've never written a race report and I think
[63.12s -> 68.16s]  you could argue that I still haven't really written a race report even though that's kind
[68.16s -> 74.40s]  of you know in that area but it's like I just thought it would be interesting to kind of
[74.40s -> 80.94s]  write something that was like not like you know like race reports a lot of times are
[80.94s -> 84.14s]  like pretty boring they're just like oh and then I ate this and then I felt like
[84.14s -> 88.46s]  shit and then I ate this and then I felt a little better and then I you know it's like I
[88.46s -> 93.50s]  don't know who wants to read that stuff but it's like I just I don't know I just thought it would
[93.50s -> 98.14s]  be interesting to write something like what was actually just kind of going on in in my head
[98.14s -> 103.82s]  the entire time like as I pass people like the things I think about and um it just sort
[103.82s -> 110.46s]  of came out in this very like sort of like punchy yeah like you said hunter s thompson
[110.46s -> 117.74s]  style of like writing and um and yeah just like I think just being like a
[118.70s -> 123.34s]  like sci-fi fantasy nerd too it's just like that like that's just like kind of the stuff
[123.34s -> 128.46s]  I think about while I'm out there like I like I don't know what what are your influences in
[128.46s -> 133.34s]  the sci-fi space like where you were what are you drawing from oh god I don't know just like
[134.38s -> 137.90s]  yeah like I've always been obsessed with like dune I've always been obsessed like I'm
[137.90s -> 142.54s]  a huge Tolkien nerd like obviously if you read that it's yeah pretty obvious
[145.10s -> 152.94s]  and yeah it's like and so I just I I kind of draw influences from that just sort of in an
[152.94s -> 158.54s]  imagination sense and um I don't know I don't write that many things I wish it was something
[158.54s -> 164.30s]  that I did more of you know um and it's always been a goal of mine my entire adult
[164.30s -> 169.02s]  life to like carve out more space for like writing especially creative writing and um
[170.14s -> 178.14s]  like I said I don't I don't always find the time to do it but um yeah so like all of that
[178.14s -> 183.42s]  just to say like I don't know I had fun writing it it was like this cool little thing and
[186.10s -> 189.38s]  there was just a lot going on that first year and I think I think especially
[190.10s -> 194.90s]  like doing mushrooms at the beginning of that year which I also did this year by the way but
[194.90s -> 204.10s]  uh um it just sort of sets a direction for your for your experience you know and
[205.46s -> 211.70s]  and I don't know it makes me feel a lot better when I'm like running up Eldon at mile 240 that
[211.70s -> 216.90s]  like you know this probably wasn't as hard as like Frodo and Sam running up Mount Doom to
[216.90s -> 222.58s]  like destroy the ring you know so it's like I draw a lot of dumb motivations from stuff
[222.58s -> 227.46s]  like that you know so I was fortunate to come across it just before this year's
[227.46s -> 231.38s]  Kokedome and I was running so after passing through Crown King and getting to that kind
[231.38s -> 235.70s]  of like a rastra area I couldn't help but think about like the Minds of Moria references too
[235.70s -> 240.18s]  so the preamble to that was pretty close like it just it added perspective in life to my own
[240.18s -> 244.90s]  experience and not like you said not a lot of race reports do that it's a lot of it I
[244.90s -> 248.10s]  don't want to say it's a it's not a transactional experience but you're typically
[248.74s -> 253.14s]  clicking into those to get advice on how to do things in the future and I didn't necessarily
[253.14s -> 258.42s]  get lessons for how to execute Kokedome it was more just like adding local color and
[258.42s -> 262.82s]  really rich history in context to it which I appreciate deeply.
[263.62s -> 268.50s]  That's awesome yeah and I mean yeah which is easy for me to do I mean like I you know
[268.50s -> 275.14s]  growing up in those hills and just experiencing all that stuff and just like sort of putting
[275.14s -> 281.86s]  that lens on the entire experience and yeah just writing a silly story basically is all
[281.86s -> 288.10s]  that race report is it's just a big long silly story stuff it's awesome that people like it
[288.10s -> 292.82s]  and that people like you you know like future runners of Kokedome can read it and
[294.66s -> 301.86s]  that was actually a big part of me actually releasing it is because it kind of sat I
[301.86s -> 307.22s]  think I had it written for like you know quite a long time before I finally decided to share
[307.22s -> 317.38s]  it publicly and but yeah just wanting to give back positively and sort of
[319.94s -> 323.78s]  to Aravipa and the whole race Kokedome in general is like it's a race that I
[323.78s -> 330.90s]  care about and it's a race I feel involved in and so yeah just wanting to give things
[330.90s -> 335.30s]  to that and make you know contribute to the lore of Kokedome a little bit which
[336.42s -> 341.38s]  I feel like that's all I've really done is contribute to the lore of Kokedome so
[343.22s -> 346.74s]  there was a one there was a quote there were many quotes in there that
[346.74s -> 351.78s]  stuck with me one of them you say I have to prove to myself that this world is worth being
[351.78s -> 358.10s]  in which I think is a really unusual take on existence explain that thinking more I mean
[358.58s -> 363.06s]  that's a day I mean it's a little easier now I have a daughter now and I'm not quite so like
[366.98s -> 373.06s]  I'm not living in this like constant state of existential crises these days I have I'm
[373.06s -> 380.34s]  a little more calm and but I don't know I feel like I'm a person who is constantly seeking
[380.34s -> 390.50s]  validation for existence and trying to find things that validate my own experience and my
[390.50s -> 397.06s]  own life and making sure I'm not wasting it and you know I'm not really a religious person
[397.06s -> 401.38s]  so I sort of believe this is all we have and trying to make the most of that and
[403.46s -> 408.82s]  yeah and it's hard I think sometimes it's really easy to get drugged down in this
[408.82s -> 414.42s]  world this world's a tough place and there's a lot of bad things and a lot of negativity
[414.42s -> 418.02s]  with human beings in the world and it's easy to go down those rabbit holes and
[419.22s -> 425.30s]  so finding things for me to feel excited about and feel stoked about and you know
[427.54s -> 433.62s]  meeting people that also I live in sort of a difficult place in in this country
[433.70s -> 435.54s]  culturally speaking and so
[437.86s -> 444.26s]  for me getting to experience these races and these things with other like-minded people who
[444.26s -> 450.42s]  are all about experience as well and sort of living life to the fullest whatever that means
[450.42s -> 457.10s]  or whatever sort of tropes you want to throw in there but yeah it's it's hard you know it's
[457.10s -> 462.86s]  a constant it's a constant battle to to or not maybe not a battle but it's a constant
[462.86s -> 468.46s]  sort of practice that at least I have to engage in continuously to sort of you know I don't I
[468.46s -> 472.94s]  don't get a lot out of things I've done in the past I don't you know I don't look back on things
[472.94s -> 478.54s]  I've done I feel like super proud or like oh that was awesome I'm super fulfilled you know
[478.54s -> 484.94s]  it's like I kind of have to keep keep looking and keep experiencing and
[487.26s -> 491.82s]  and that's kind of my whole identity it's kind of wrapped up in a nutshell right there so
[493.10s -> 497.82s]  you mentioned sort of it's been a struggle at least recently to be in the environment you're in
[497.82s -> 502.46s]  and I could be mistaken I always thought that you were kind of waving the banner for how awesome
[502.46s -> 510.78s]  Arizona is and being proud to be there talk about that more yeah well I think I am very
[510.78s -> 519.76s]  I do love Arizona I mean I don't love it culturally I don't you know I think yeah this
[519.76s -> 524.00s]  might be one of those conversations if we get two and two needs some editing but
[525.36s -> 536.40s]  it's just like you know I have a hard time with a lot of traditional American values you know and
[539.52s -> 545.28s]  you know I live in somebody told me once and I don't know if it's true or not because people
[545.28s -> 549.04s]  use superlatives all the time when they're not true but somebody told me once that like
[549.04s -> 553.28s]  the county I live is in is the most conservative county in the United States
[554.72s -> 559.76s]  so it's like over 90 percent of our people vote for Donald Trump and I would also argue that
[560.80s -> 566.16s]  the town I live in has the highest per capita of like shitty bumper stickers and flags on
[566.16s -> 571.84s]  their vehicles so that's like a lot of what I see when I'm like driving around town and
[573.04s -> 576.64s]  and meeting people and the people like I don't have that many good friends who actually
[576.64s -> 582.08s]  live in Prescott most of my good friends live either overseas or in other states so
[584.96s -> 588.56s]  yeah so without getting too negative I'll say you know that's about
[589.28s -> 594.56s]  you know that's sort of culturally the world that I live in I would say like geographically
[594.56s -> 601.92s]  and and yeah like outdoorsy wise speaking I think Arizona is one of the most amazing places
[601.92s -> 606.24s]  in the world I mean the diversity of stuff you can do here is pretty amazing and
[607.76s -> 611.44s]  I think it's hard for people who've lived in the southwest to ever live
[611.44s -> 617.44s]  leave the southwest I think that's like a really common thing because it's pretty nice but
[618.80s -> 623.20s]  yeah so I I do have a lot of Arizona like pride in that sense but it's not
[623.20s -> 627.04s]  really revolved around the culture the people all that much you know like
[627.12s -> 634.72s]  like and that's actually gotten worse I think lately that I used to be just growing up in
[634.72s -> 642.48s]  Arizona in general I've developed a really high sense of like just sort of tolerating a lot of
[642.48s -> 647.44s]  that stuff and I think that actually comes from my background of hitchhiking like I like I
[647.44s -> 653.68s]  hitchhiked for like since from when I was like 18 till I was like I don't know 10 years or
[653.68s -> 659.04s]  something I probably all everywhere I went was hitchhiking wow so when you hitchhike a lot you
[659.04s -> 666.32s]  develop this you develop this like personality skill of just being very agreeable with whoever
[666.32s -> 671.28s]  you get in the car with like no matter what they have on their agenda that they feel like
[671.28s -> 675.36s]  they want to talk to you about you develop a skill for being very agreeable to things that
[675.36s -> 681.04s]  like you don't necessarily agree with that much and I think I think I'm starting to lose
[681.04s -> 688.00s]  that now and I think maybe part of that has to do with having a daughter and having a kid in
[688.00s -> 692.80s]  this world is I'm a little less tolerant of things that I perceive to be negative
[694.80s -> 697.84s]  you know like guns for example like I live in a very like pro-gun
[698.40s -> 704.56s]  place where a lot of people's identities is wrapped up and carrying guns on them at all
[704.56s -> 711.52s]  times like you know like my sponsors from Paris and and they always come here and literally every
[711.52s -> 716.32s]  single time somebody new from Satisfy Running comes to Prescott that first night they come
[716.32s -> 720.80s]  over and was like I was in the fucking grocery store and there was a guy wearing a gun on his
[720.80s -> 725.76s]  belt and it's like it's like blows their minds and it's like well it's like half the
[725.76s -> 732.48s]  population here like carries you know and so it's like um so with something like that
[732.48s -> 736.56s]  whereas I've always just been able to ignore it now that I have a daughter it's like okay like
[736.56s -> 741.60s]  you're not allowed to come over to my house if you have a gun on you like period like if you
[741.60s -> 746.88s]  can't take your gun off before you come into my home like you're just not invited over
[746.88s -> 751.52s]  anymore like sorry yeah so like I think that's a good example of like I've gotten like less
[751.52s -> 757.44s]  tolerant of things but I don't know that that's a bad thing I don't know it's like it's like
[757.44s -> 762.00s]  we always preach tolerance and everything you know but I'm getting like a little like shorter
[762.00s -> 768.72s]  with it like you know it's like I don't know so I mean maybe maybe as a positive to that all that
[768.72s -> 773.60s]  if there is a positive and this is just my subjective opinion it seems like when you're in
[773.60s -> 779.44s]  a place where there is an overwhelming majority or status quo that's where the coolest counter
[779.44s -> 784.64s]  cultures exist across the world and there are some really beautiful things that happen when
[784.64s -> 788.64s]  you have something very clear to react or respond to I don't know if that's been your
[788.64s -> 792.80s]  experience yeah no I mean that yin and yang there's a really cool yin and yang opportunity
[792.80s -> 797.44s]  there I mean growing up in like punk and hardcore bands and like skateboarding my whole life like
[797.44s -> 804.40s]  clearly I mean I think I think 99 percent of like punk rock is reactionary which is like you
[804.40s -> 810.16s]  could argue isn't actually very punk because you're just you're just reacting to whatever
[810.16s -> 814.48s]  you know what I mean so it's like punk rock like punk rock to me is more about like being
[814.48s -> 820.16s]  genuine and authentic and however you can be that just reacting to something and doing the
[820.16s -> 825.52s]  negative of that your entire life is something I've done like for sure but I've also like
[826.08s -> 832.16s]  reflect on that and if I'm just reacting to things if I'm just reacting to whatever like
[832.16s -> 837.04s]  it is is in popular culture and doing the opposite then that's not very like creative
[837.04s -> 841.92s]  or original either so it's like but I do think you're right like I mean like salt lake city
[841.92s -> 845.92s]  you know what I mean is like punk scene great underground punk scene it's like I mean even the
[845.92s -> 850.00s]  hardcore scene is like one of the most like violent hardcore scenes like in the country
[850.00s -> 854.64s]  like back when like when straight edge and like so it's like yeah like salt lake city
[854.64s -> 859.68s]  like tends to take things everything like way too far because they're growing up in this
[859.68s -> 864.32s]  like super oppressed culture you know like I mean it's like I think salt lake's pretty
[864.32s -> 869.76s]  known for that you know and um but no I think you're absolutely right and so like
[870.64s -> 877.44s]  you know like I am I don't I don't think I'm like super unique or special like like I am
[877.44s -> 882.32s]  very much a product of my environment like I grew up in Prescott Arizona and it's like I think
[882.32s -> 886.80s]  a lot of things about me even though we all like to pretend like we're super unique and
[886.80s -> 892.72s]  like special like I'm definitely a product of my environment and um I think that there are a
[892.72s -> 898.80s]  lot of things about my personality and about my lifestyle that do reflect like sort of Arizona
[899.44s -> 906.96s]  values and culture but um sort of on these big picture stuff I sort of I have a hard time with
[906.96s -> 913.60s]  it for sure so um I think it's also why I like I I grab on to people sometimes like
[913.60s -> 918.16s]  like I think I did that was satisfying like when I met those guys I was like you guys
[918.16s -> 921.76s]  are really fucking awesome and I just like grabbed on you know and it's like we're all
[921.76s -> 928.72s]  like best friends now you know and it's it's like so when I when I meet people that I really
[928.72s -> 936.56s]  click with or jive with I become friends pretty quickly with them um because I sort of like I
[936.56s -> 943.84s]  haven't I don't have a lot of that in my like day to day you know so but with coming back
[943.84s -> 948.88s]  to coca-dona you mentioned that you know well I don't want to put words in your mouth
[948.88s -> 952.88s]  but it was cool to sort of contribute to the lore of the race which I think is a really
[952.88s -> 957.36s]  interesting way of thinking about it in that race report you said that after year one you
[957.36s -> 962.80s]  could tell this race is going to change big things are going to happen Aerovite but kind of
[962.80s -> 967.44s]  change the game a little bit so you were expecting it then I'm curious to know like
[967.44s -> 972.56s]  you know four years on are you happy with the way things are tracking do you like the
[972.56s -> 975.60s]  direction the race is going in because I know that this is this is going to be your last year
[975.60s -> 983.09s]  racing it so talk about your thoughts on where it stands four years in yeah I mean I was you know
[984.37s -> 992.53s]  I was right right it's like it's it's this big thing and um I mean I don't think I was like
[992.53s -> 998.85s]  the only one that perceived that I think that was like a general feeling after that first year
[998.85s -> 1006.05s]  um and after the live stream and just like the amount of attention I got for it you know
[1006.05s -> 1013.33s]  what I mean like I've never experienced something like that before and um you know I'm not I'm not
[1013.33s -> 1020.21s]  one of these like but I'm not one of these runners that's you know used to a lot of
[1020.21s -> 1024.37s]  attention you know it's like before Kokedona I think people knew who I was because of like
[1024.37s -> 1029.33s]  a couple things through running but you could just you could just tell that there was
[1029.33s -> 1033.41s]  something like there was some sort of buzz around that whole live stream and that whole
[1033.41s -> 1039.09s]  week and that whole thing what was happening and um and then you fast forward to what the race is
[1039.09s -> 1048.13s]  I mean even this year and like your experience and um and I think yeah like you mentioned
[1048.93s -> 1053.97s]  I think in one of your emails how you you perceive it going even crazier which I do as
[1053.97s -> 1059.73s]  well and um that was a big part of me agreeing to be a part of this documentary
[1059.73s -> 1067.25s]  that's being made about the race this year was um I was initially um a little bit apprehensive about
[1067.25s -> 1075.49s]  being a part of it and then um I sort of realized that for whatever reason even though I'm like
[1075.49s -> 1084.29s]  constantly deflecting and constantly trying to push that stuff aside um there are a lot of
[1084.29s -> 1091.97s]  people in this world that sort of see this like alternative way of doing being a part of the sport
[1091.97s -> 1096.45s]  and they see me as the person that like represents that for whatever reason and so
[1096.45s -> 1100.93s]  just sorting sort of setting humility aside for a second and like filling those shoes and
[1101.89s -> 1106.53s]  I think it is important especially if it is my last year running that this is sort of my like
[1107.25s -> 1113.97s]  like put my stamp on the race and put put how I think people should approach this race and
[1113.97s -> 1120.53s]  experience this race and like sort of wish it well and um because the reality is like as years
[1120.53s -> 1129.97s]  go by like you know like I'm not going to have that opportunity so um I do hope coca
[1129.97s -> 1135.41s]  donna grows as naturally and as appropriately as possible but I mean that's a hard thing
[1135.41s -> 1139.73s]  you know I don't even think Jamil is really in control of how these races I don't think any race
[1139.73s -> 1144.61s]  director is really in that that much control about how the what happens to the races I mean
[1144.61s -> 1151.25s]  there's certainly things that you can do but um yeah I mean just this whole like hyper
[1151.81s -> 1157.97s]  you know the whole hyper competitive like influencer shit that exists in our sport now
[1157.97s -> 1163.73s]  you know it's like I was actually so I was in Bryce all last week because I marked the
[1163.73s -> 1169.89s]  trail I marked the trails for those ultras up in Utah and sure um we were like sitting around a
[1169.89s -> 1174.37s]  campfire like talking about like why do I even care like why do I give a shit like
[1175.17s -> 1178.85s]  why do I care what and how anyone else is experiencing the trails out there and I
[1178.85s -> 1182.77s]  think that's a good question to like ask yourself like why do we care how other people
[1182.77s -> 1189.09s]  are experiencing these races or these trails and um I think when you have something that's
[1189.09s -> 1195.33s]  like trail running that has become like a big part of who you are and it's like it's an activity
[1195.33s -> 1199.41s]  that is like really special and dear to you and you see people coming in with motives that you
[1199.41s -> 1205.65s]  don't value you don't appreciate and you not only see them doing it that way but also being
[1205.65s -> 1211.73s]  praised like publicly for doing it that way and it's it's wanting to like hold that thing
[1211.73s -> 1218.93s]  that you have hold dear and and keep it how you think it should be I guess which isn't necessarily
[1219.89s -> 1226.53s]  great but um it's it's it's what it is and I you know like I said I do care about
[1226.53s -> 1230.93s]  coca-dona as a race I do care about I mean I care about a lot of other things too but you
[1230.93s -> 1238.53s]  know I'm not making documentaries about other things so um well you know you mentioned as
[1238.53s -> 1242.77s]  you get older being less tolerant which I can empathize with it you know I'm not quite as
[1242.77s -> 1247.89s]  old as you I'm maybe a couple years behind but I'm also entering into that stage of thinking
[1247.89s -> 1252.45s]  you clearly have a style you clearly have a point of view which I also appreciate
[1253.01s -> 1258.77s]  one thing I'm excited about with this movie is to me it represents like four distinct
[1258.77s -> 1264.13s]  points of view and value in sort of like perspectives on the sport all clashing on one
[1264.13s -> 1269.09s]  start like I love that value clash and I'm wondering if you do too like despite having
[1269.09s -> 1273.17s]  maybe just like sort of like a I don't want to say rigid but you clearly have a point of view
[1273.17s -> 1277.17s]  do you appreciate the opportunity for your point of view and your world view on the trail
[1277.17s -> 1282.69s]  running to be in the arena with like you know this hyper professionalized hyper influencer
[1282.69s -> 1286.85s]  like do you do appreciate the opportunity for all of those world views to kind of like
[1286.85s -> 1292.93s]  do battle at coca-dona I do yeah and I actually think that's like kind of awesome
[1293.49s -> 1298.45s]  like part about the sport is that like I mean it's actually one reason why I like racing in
[1298.45s -> 1305.49s]  Europe because like the percentage of like those the opposite end of the spectrum runners
[1305.49s -> 1309.49s]  of me like that's a lot higher I feel like like I feel like in a lot of ways I'm sort of like
[1309.49s -> 1316.53s]  a North American trail runner like stereotype you know what I mean just like dirty fucking
[1316.53s -> 1320.37s]  trail runner you know and it's like but that doesn't really exist in Europe like almost
[1320.37s -> 1323.97s]  everyone over there is like that other thing that you're talking about and so like
[1324.69s -> 1330.37s]  I think it's kind of funny because like especially if I can do well at races it's
[1330.37s -> 1335.01s]  like all these like hyper competitive guys that are like taking shit really seriously
[1335.01s -> 1340.37s]  and like I come running by with like hairy bearded no shirt and like on mushrooms and
[1340.37s -> 1344.21s]  I'm like you know it's like so it's like I do get a little bit of a kick out of that
[1344.21s -> 1350.69s]  like for sure but yeah and I think like coca-dona this year was like special too
[1350.69s -> 1355.65s]  because like I got to spend time with like that so for listeners that don't know the film is
[1355.65s -> 1361.81s]  following like five or now six of us actually because of what happened at the race and you
[1361.81s -> 1367.17s]  know I got to spend time minus McKnight I got to spend time with all of those guys for
[1367.17s -> 1372.37s]  pretty sizable chunks of the run and I think what's cool is that like you know like myself
[1372.37s -> 1376.37s]  and Jeff Browning don't like have that much in common like to talk about you know what I mean
[1376.37s -> 1383.81s]  it's like he's you know he's a very serious athlete he like knows a lot about like shit
[1383.81s -> 1390.45s]  and I don't know anything like like that and but I think it provides opportunities to like
[1390.45s -> 1394.93s]  find things that you do like like me being a new father and him being a father of like
[1394.93s -> 1400.29s]  teenagers and adults and it's like like Jeff and I just talked about being dads for like
[1401.25s -> 1405.89s]  five hours you know what I mean and like got emotional about stuff and it's like
[1405.89s -> 1410.61s]  so I think it provides those opportunities to like just because people have different
[1410.61s -> 1416.05s]  interests or than you do doesn't mean you can't find like common ground on I mean we're all
[1416.05s -> 1421.81s]  out there running 250 miles we all have something clearly in common but it's also
[1421.81s -> 1427.09s]  like finding those things like I'm sure you know with other runners like he talked about
[1427.09s -> 1431.49s]  like diet and like pay that was actually one thing is like my experience this year was like
[1432.69s -> 1437.73s]  like it was very clearly that they were all racing each other I would say the other four
[1437.73s -> 1443.81s]  runners out of the top five like they were all like clearly racing each other and I had never
[1443.81s -> 1447.81s]  experienced that at coca-dona like it like I don't think any other year that I've been a
[1447.81s -> 1452.45s]  part of it well did it ever feel like a race or did it ever feel like there was
[1452.53s -> 1459.01s]  competition or and this year like it did like those guys were like constantly checking like
[1459.01s -> 1464.29s]  where the other runners were on the like live stream and about like pace and about how many
[1464.29s -> 1470.93s]  calories they took down and like blah blah blah and it's like well I built a mini ramp last
[1470.93s -> 1476.13s]  you know so it's like yeah it's like so just um yeah that was interesting this year just to
[1476.13s -> 1481.65s]  sort of experience that that competitive thing I think it's also like really I actually really
[1481.65s -> 1488.37s]  love that I ended up in fifth place though like because it just felt like those other four guys
[1488.37s -> 1494.45s]  were taking it more seriously so like they they deserve to be up there you know it's uh so it
[1494.45s -> 1498.37s]  was like in a lot of ways because I wasn't really I didn't ever feel like I was racing I
[1498.37s -> 1503.01s]  just sort of feel like I had the best seat in the house like I just got to be up there
[1503.01s -> 1508.13s]  with those guys and like experience their races for however amount much amount of time
[1508.85s -> 1513.65s]  and it was really awesome just to meet just to get to know those guys better and to experience
[1513.65s -> 1518.45s]  like experience because again because I'm not super hyper competitive or like know a lot about
[1518.45s -> 1523.41s]  like you know like Jeff knows every fucking thing there is to know about how to be a
[1523.41s -> 1527.57s]  good trail runner and I know absolutely nothing about how to be a good trail runner so it's
[1527.57s -> 1532.69s]  just really interesting to get to experience the race through some of these other lenses
[1533.49s -> 1542.05s]  um of these of these serious good athletes you know and um that was that was kind of awesome
[1542.05s -> 1548.13s]  for me until you know obviously I fell back and lost track of all those guys but um yeah.
[1548.69s -> 1554.85s]  Did it make you want to be them at all in the sense that you observed what it took for them
[1554.85s -> 1559.81s]  to log those performances and seeing them you know throughout maybe the first couple days
[1559.81s -> 1564.61s]  of the race were you like I kind of want to be that to some extent or were you like more
[1564.61s -> 1569.89s]  observational being like I've seen what it takes I see who they are and I'm still going
[1569.89s -> 1577.17s]  to stay who I am. It made me want to uh like like I keep bringing up Jeff but like Jeff
[1577.17s -> 1582.93s]  is such a fucking professional like it it kind of blew my mind like because a lot of the
[1582.93s -> 1590.05s]  times like you know the it doesn't surprise me that he did so well at Cocodona because
[1591.57s -> 1600.05s]  a lot of Cocodona is just minimizing the time wasted over three days if you're if you're if
[1600.05s -> 1604.85s]  you're being competitive and trying to be as fast as you can there's like you know I think
[1604.85s -> 1609.01s]  between myself and the winner like so I was in fifth place so like the top five guys were
[1609.01s -> 1613.49s]  within like I don't know five hours or whatever the times were like five hours of each other
[1614.13s -> 1621.57s]  like there's not a lot of that time is made up or lost during the running moving yeah
[1621.57s -> 1627.49s]  a lot of it is the time when you're not moving and and so it doesn't surprise me the
[1627.49s -> 1634.53s]  ones that were best at being like ultra runners at being athletes at being professionals
[1634.53s -> 1643.01s]  I think did the best um and especially like with the sleep thing like like I wasted so much
[1643.01s -> 1650.53s]  fucking time this year trying to sleep and try and being unsuccessful and like like if you can
[1650.53s -> 1654.37s]  lay down and just go to sleep like you're going to do really well at Cocodona I think
[1654.37s -> 1659.65s]  like if you can lay down and be out for 15 to 20 minutes I think that you have a skill
[1659.73s -> 1666.77s]  set that works really well at Cocodona if you've had insomnia insomnia your entire life and can't
[1666.77s -> 1674.21s]  ever sleep like me then it's like like yeah you just and and not being able to sleep starts to
[1674.21s -> 1679.57s]  snowball so like that second night every single aid station you're like I have to try
[1679.57s -> 1683.49s]  and sleep again and so you're laying down at every aid station like through that second
[1683.65s -> 1689.41s]  night and it's just like so anyways like I was blown away by Jeff's professionalism I
[1689.41s -> 1696.53s]  mean the first day at Cocodona I got to crown king and like I just wasn't in the mood for
[1696.53s -> 1701.25s]  the circus that crown king is and everyone yelling like in your face and like trying to
[1701.25s -> 1704.53s]  give you shit and I just got like flustered it's like I gotta get the fuck out of here
[1704.53s -> 1709.33s]  and I just like put my pack on and left and I left with and I left and caught up to Jeff
[1709.33s -> 1713.17s]  and right when I caught up to Jeff I was like oh shit I left with zero calories for this
[1714.05s -> 1719.65s]  16 mile stretch on the first day so like Jeff gave me like four gummy bears he's like here like
[1719.65s -> 1724.37s]  eat these you know it's like so that's just what I mean like he's like he's a professional
[1724.37s -> 1730.13s]  and I'm clearly not I'm just like running into these places like like I don't know like just
[1730.13s -> 1735.41s]  give me some food and I mean I could be better at it but I'm like I don't or like at
[1735.65s -> 1745.01s]  Whisky Row this year I built my own waistband this year out of like a bunch of prototype
[1745.01s -> 1749.49s]  belts that Satisfied made me and like sewed them all together so I had this like mega belt
[1750.21s -> 1756.85s]  that I was like I wanted to use for the night sections at Cocodona because I don't wear a vest
[1756.85s -> 1761.81s]  very often or ever besides at Cocodona so I like by day two and three my shoulders and
[1761.81s -> 1765.25s]  neck start to hurt really bad so I was like well if I can make something where I can carry
[1765.25s -> 1770.13s]  everything I need for the night sections I can give my shoulders and neck a break and so when
[1770.13s -> 1774.21s]  I got to Whisky Row that was the first section that I was going to do that with and I put my
[1774.21s -> 1778.93s]  waist belt on and I headed out and I ran about eight or nine miles and I was behind
[1778.93s -> 1785.57s]  I was almost to Iron King and I realized that I left my fucking tracker on my on my vest
[1786.29s -> 1793.01s]  back at Whisky Row so I spent like an hour on the phone with Steve and Jamil like talking about
[1793.01s -> 1798.93s]  like what I could possibly do and it was either well I can continue or be disqualified
[1798.93s -> 1805.01s]  or I can go back to Whisky Row I was like well there's that's my whole fucking race is
[1805.01s -> 1811.65s]  over you know it's like um and I got really lucky because I don't wear a watch either
[1812.37s -> 1819.17s]  um so I wasn't like tracking anything and I got really lucky because my phone in the background
[1819.17s -> 1826.45s]  like the fitness app tracks shit without my knowledge so it was the first time like
[1826.45s -> 1830.37s]  something ever like like that ever happened to me where I was like super stoked and I was able
[1830.37s -> 1835.97s]  to pull up like my mileage and send them my exact location and like prove that I had like
[1835.97s -> 1841.33s]  and I was with other runners at that point so and like and like Arlen and he was like other
[1841.33s -> 1845.81s]  runners would have vouched for me and like and and so Steve just made a decision where he was
[1845.81s -> 1852.13s]  like well like you know based on like all but anyways I was like sitting on a rock for like
[1852.13s -> 1857.65s]  an hour like sending him screenshots and sending him like GPS tracks and like all this stuff
[1857.65s -> 1863.25s]  about how like and so I say all of that to say like I'm not trying to say that I should
[1863.25s -> 1867.57s]  have done better I could have done better it's like I think I did about as good as I could
[1867.57s -> 1872.45s]  like I think every runner out there had some experience like that where they felt you know
[1872.45s -> 1879.17s]  like Stringbean ran the wrong way on a trail and like ran into Jeff and the Dells somehow
[1879.17s -> 1883.09s]  Stringbean got turned around and was running the wrong direction and then like hit Jeff and
[1883.09s -> 1887.65s]  Jeff was like oh you're going the wrong way but I mean I think everyone has screw-ups
[1887.65s -> 1893.65s]  but I think the ones that won I think the guys that got like top two top three at Cocodona had
[1895.25s -> 1900.13s]  the least amount of fuck-ups basically and and I think that comes from being
[1901.25s -> 1905.09s]  on the Jeff Browning side of the spectrum not my side of the spectrum
[1906.21s -> 1910.69s]  but it's so interesting to me that someone like you and just based on what I can tell
[1910.69s -> 1916.61s]  you're not a killer right like you were not frothing at the mouth to just like yeah kill
[1916.61s -> 1921.65s]  your like really like destroy your competition that someone like you with your disposition
[1921.65s -> 1925.17s]  can do as well as you do at the front of these races because maybe that's just something that's
[1925.17s -> 1930.37s]  unique about ultra running but when I think about sports like basketball and football and
[1931.41s -> 1936.45s]  UFC and stuff like that like yeah I don't feel like you can thrive with that personality
[1936.45s -> 1940.45s]  no I think I think Cocodona is good for calling that shit out and people too
[1941.57s -> 1945.09s]  I mean to a point I mean there's still like people out there competing with each other
[1945.09s -> 1951.09s]  obviously but I think that's why I like ultra running because like the longer you go with
[1951.09s -> 1960.21s]  stuff the less that that that shit starts to like sort of bleed away and but yeah I don't
[1960.21s -> 1966.29s]  I I I mean I think that was a another aspect to me agreeing to be a part of the film was
[1966.29s -> 1970.53s]  like just to show people that like you don't have to be like this like hyper competitive
[1971.09s -> 1978.13s]  said foaming at the mouth like David Goggins douchebag to like be to be like good at the
[1978.13s -> 1983.49s]  sport you know it's like so I mean like speaking of David like David Goggin I only found out who
[1983.49s -> 1990.53s]  David Goggins was like six months ago I like I and and my wife and I like watched like some
[1990.53s -> 1995.73s]  of his stuff and it like it connected a lot of dots for me because you see these like hyper
[1995.73s -> 2001.25s]  competitive this there's this ass there's this thing that's happening in trail running right now
[2002.69s -> 2008.37s]  and it's like this like hyper it's this like super masculine super macho hyper competitive
[2008.37s -> 2013.73s]  like the language these people use like like we're like I'm gonna destroy Cocodona like
[2013.73s -> 2018.53s]  we're gonna conquer the core like how the fuck do you conquer a terrain like you can't
[2018.53s -> 2022.85s]  like I don't know it's just like this like super aggressive language that's coming I was
[2022.85s -> 2027.09s]  like and then and then when I found out who he was I was like and I like watched some of the shit
[2027.09s -> 2031.97s]  I was like oh that's like where this is is that where this is coming from like all these people
[2031.97s -> 2037.49s]  are trying to be like this and it's like I just don't think and so again the becoming
[2037.49s -> 2043.33s]  less tolerant of stuff I just I'm disgusted that that's a part of something that I care
[2043.33s -> 2049.49s]  about so much that sort of mentality of like like celebrating the failures of others
[2049.49s -> 2055.81s]  you know what I mean like it's one like it's one thing to win a race and to set a course record
[2055.81s -> 2060.85s]  or like do whatever it's like and to celebrate your own personal achievement and to celebrate
[2060.85s -> 2066.05s]  like good job it's another thing to celebrate the failures of the runners around you like
[2066.05s -> 2070.45s]  like the the people who wish ill will on runners that are ahead of them if you're being
[2070.45s -> 2076.29s]  competitive like that sort of mentality I'm disgusted with the fact that that could have
[2076.29s -> 2083.01s]  a place in a sport that I hold dear yeah and I just like I said I'm getting less tolerant of it
[2083.01s -> 2089.01s]  and I like I don't you know I just so again agreeing to be a part of the film is like
[2089.97s -> 2095.17s]  try and influence people to have some better values to have some like why we do think of
[2095.17s -> 2099.17s]  why we're doing these things and again one reason why I've agreed to be a part of a race
[2099.17s -> 2106.77s]  like coca-donas I think of races like coca-dona sort of force you into that I think races like
[2106.77s -> 2112.77s]  coca-dona have a way of humbling people and and like especially people who have never
[2112.77s -> 2117.57s]  experienced the multi-day running thing like I think you're like I don't know if you would
[2117.57s -> 2125.57s]  ever experience anything like a multi-day run um but yeah maybe I'll interview you maybe I'll
[2125.57s -> 2131.73s]  ask you about like your experience like just experiencing something like coca-dona for the
[2131.73s -> 2137.41s]  first time you know well and I'll answer in a second but I just want to bring up one and I'm
[2137.41s -> 2141.01s]  not going to call it a counterpoint I'll just call it another perspective because there are
[2141.01s -> 2145.25s]  people out there and again maybe this is more relevant in other sports but they would tell
[2145.25s -> 2153.57s]  you that great performances in generally great competition is suffering from like this mental
[2153.57s -> 2157.57s]  health awareness movement right where like people are becoming more mentally healthy and
[2157.57s -> 2164.21s]  because of that they're losing that edge that has generated amazing results in years past so
[2164.21s -> 2169.01s]  like I mean I know you're a basketball fan like Chris Paul I'm not saying he's mentally
[2169.01s -> 2173.41s]  unwell but like Chris Paul and Devin Booker and Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant like
[2173.97s -> 2176.93s]  they start to get mental health counseling they get things right in their head
[2178.05s -> 2181.65s]  they're no longer the killers on the court that won you know six NBA titles
[2181.65s -> 2184.61s]  and we're just relentless so um what do you think about that?
[2185.57s -> 2190.53s]  I think that you're you were a part of a conversation that we were having last week
[2190.53s -> 2196.69s]  around the campfire where I said that literally exact same thing I said that I said that I
[2196.69s -> 2209.42s]  think that um people in sports today like especially fans especially older fans they get
[2209.42s -> 2214.14s]  really really upset when their team loses and the players don't it doesn't seem to like affect
[2214.14s -> 2218.86s]  the players very much and and they get upset they're like how can I as a fan care more
[2219.58s -> 2225.02s]  or at least appear to care more than the players do and it's like well one thing the
[2225.02s -> 2232.30s]  player that player is getting paid you know 250 million dollars to play a sport and he's
[2232.30s -> 2236.38s]  he's like a young 20 year old these are like young kids making hundreds of millions of
[2236.38s -> 2242.38s]  dollars the world is their oyster they but but but also on top of that I think and this is
[2242.38s -> 2247.58s]  what you're talking about is that mental health is like not a shameful thing to talk about
[2247.58s -> 2252.38s]  anymore and these kids are coming up like I think this younger generation is like
[2253.02s -> 2258.38s]  they're at least aware of mental health and yeah I mean I think the examples you used are
[2258.38s -> 2263.98s]  really awesome I think Kobe Bryant is like not a mentally healthy person and as a result
[2263.98s -> 2269.66s]  like yeah the players today can handle losses a little bit better than I think players of
[2269.66s -> 2275.02s]  previous generations and I think that yes sport is suffering from that and I think but
[2275.02s -> 2280.94s]  I think that's a good thing like I'm like again like just like these conservative American
[2280.94s -> 2287.34s]  values I don't think like hyper hyper competitiveness and like these like hyper
[2287.34s -> 2292.70s]  capitalistic ideas of like crushing everyone around you and everything in front of you
[2293.98s -> 2301.02s]  is that good for you is that good for anybody so like I think the fact that I have a running
[2301.02s -> 2308.30s]  sponsor is is is like a great example of what we're talking about like
[2310.62s -> 2317.50s]  and so I think that there is a space for especially in today's world way more than any
[2317.50s -> 2326.70s]  other time to like and especially in ultra running it's like you know I don't know I
[2326.70s -> 2331.66s]  think it's why I'm still a part of the sport and why I'm still doing it is like
[2334.85s -> 2340.13s]  I think that there's a lot more that goes into trail running for people both on the individual
[2340.13s -> 2344.21s]  and cultural level than other sports you know what I mean there's a lot of other reasons
[2344.29s -> 2348.93s]  that we do it other than being competitive so I think that there's a big space for
[2350.05s -> 2355.41s]  like non-competitive like like I was like at no point during coca-dona did I ever wish
[2355.41s -> 2360.53s]  that I was like man I really hope Arlen slows down so I can catch him it's like no like
[2360.53s -> 2365.17s]  fuck yeah Arlen like this is your first time ever running more than 100 miles and you're
[2365.17s -> 2372.53s]  fucking crushing it and I'm like so happy for you and like and and like I was I was so
[2372.53s -> 2377.33s]  I was at so another unique thing about the coca-dona and the live stream you know so I
[2377.33s -> 2381.41s]  was out on the Arizona trail like running towards Eldon you know probably like 235
[2381.41s -> 2387.65s]  or whatever mile I was at and I was like watching Jeff and Harry finish you know so
[2387.65s -> 2392.45s]  I'm like out there running like like watching this shit and I started crying like out on the
[2392.45s -> 2398.53s]  trail like after watching it just because like I mean one I hadn't slept in like 60 hours and
[2398.61s -> 2404.77s]  I had just run 240 miles and I was like feeling super vulnerable but like I just felt for Jeff
[2404.77s -> 2410.45s]  so much like I just like I was with my pacer Marlena and and I was like I'm gonna start
[2410.45s -> 2414.61s]  crying right now she's like go for it and I fucking was crying like on the trail just
[2414.61s -> 2419.65s]  like running and I just like I just felt for Jeff so much and I was like not because I
[2419.65s -> 2423.89s]  wasn't happy for Harry like it had nothing to do with I was like super happy for Harry I
[2423.89s -> 2428.85s]  was like and blown away and impressed I was like that's fucking incredible what you did
[2428.85s -> 2433.73s]  but I also just felt for Jeff so much in the same moment and I like I just couldn't hold back
[2433.73s -> 2442.93s]  and I was like so I you know I want everyone to and it literally has nothing to do with
[2442.93s -> 2447.97s]  like what place you came in like I was so stoked for you I was blown away but like I
[2447.97s -> 2455.09s]  think that like and a special thing about coca-dona is you're aware you do get little
[2455.09s -> 2460.93s]  bits and pieces of what what other runners are doing or like what else is going on out there
[2461.57s -> 2468.53s]  and like I mean everyone knew what I mean you got seventh is that right yeah so like like
[2469.33s -> 2475.25s]  and I would include Jeff Garmire in this conversation too like like everyone sort of knew
[2475.33s -> 2481.41s]  what the six of us could do I don't think it was like surprising to anybody what the six of us did
[2481.41s -> 2486.85s]  we all knew somebody was going to run 60 hours I think we're all capable of running 60 hours
[2486.85s -> 2492.21s]  given the perfect race and just a couple people did and I think that that's fucking awesome I
[2492.21s -> 2496.37s]  don't think anyone out there knew that you were going to do what you did out there and that
[2496.37s -> 2505.65s]  to me is uh like fucking that that blew my mind more than whatever whatever happened in like
[2506.29s -> 2510.85s]  the six runners ahead of you you know what I mean so it's like I and just like Jeff
[2510.85s -> 2516.61s]  Garmire's run like like he he fucking crushed it and it's like everyone just did so awesome
[2516.61s -> 2524.21s]  and it's like the fact that like there's this persona out there that like wants to crush those
[2524.21s -> 2529.89s]  people ahead of you it's like fuck off like get it get like get out of my sport like go back to
[2529.89s -> 2536.85s]  wherever shitty thing like and again I used to be more tolerant of this and I'm just not I'm
[2536.85s -> 2543.49s]  like I'm just sick of trying to like be tolerant of it it's like I don't know so yeah do you
[2543.49s -> 2548.05s]  think you came into the race a generally content and happy person like do you feel like you
[2548.77s -> 2553.73s]  were as well adjusted as you could possibly be compared to again like the equivalent of
[2553.73s -> 2561.18s]  someone who has a Michael Jordan type personality on the start line of Cocodona yeah I think so I
[2561.18s -> 2566.54s]  think I think I uh I mean I think having a daughter last year has changed my entire
[2568.22s -> 2574.06s]  it's just changed my entire outlook towards life and just I mean all the all the things
[2574.06s -> 2585.17s]  people say about it it was like yeah um I just have like every everything I did every
[2585.17s -> 2590.29s]  like everything I do and continue to do is just like wanting to do things that like make her
[2590.29s -> 2598.53s]  proud of me and and um when she's old enough to be able to like yeah I mean it's like floated
[2598.53s -> 2601.81s]  it's like the fucking floated can you know what I mean like to me that's like kind of like
[2602.69s -> 2607.01s]  it's like a little embarrassing you know what I mean it's like uh like and it's like and
[2607.01s -> 2610.53s]  then just realizing that like float is not about me like float is about my friends and
[2610.61s -> 2615.17s]  family like getting to hold a can of soda like with me on it yeah and like laughing and being
[2615.17s -> 2619.01s]  stoked about it and like my daughter when she's old enough to be able to see a can of soda
[2619.01s -> 2625.09s]  with her dad on it it's like so yeah I think I think all of that I've never been more
[2625.09s -> 2632.13s]  well adjusted than I am now post having a kid um I think for somebody like me with my
[2632.13s -> 2638.37s]  personality type it was like everything I needed to feel like this life is worth living
[2638.93s -> 2644.93s]  um and she's given me that for the first time in my life but I but I and so I think even
[2644.93s -> 2652.77s]  besides that I think that I was never a person like when I won coca-dona the first year I
[2652.77s -> 2657.81s]  wasn't like filled with this like overwhelming sense of like satisfaction and fulfillment
[2658.61s -> 2663.57s]  you know it's like I never got a lot out of like I've won a bunch of races like I've
[2664.29s -> 2669.57s]  like I've won a bunch of other hundred milers and it's like I don't that that never did a whole
[2669.57s -> 2674.45s]  lot for me you know what I mean like people even asked me about that first year at coca-dona
[2674.45s -> 2682.98s]  like like I don't think I ran that well like personally I like I just base a lot of my
[2683.62s -> 2691.14s]  runs off of like how well I do personally and so like I'm not like I'm not more proud of
[2691.14s -> 2695.86s]  that first year than I am of this last year because I won the first year I think I ran better
[2695.86s -> 2701.30s]  this year so I'm like more stoked about my experiences here I do think maybe I had more
[2701.30s -> 2708.90s]  fun that first year that this year I was like not having that much fun for whatever reason
[2710.18s -> 2716.18s]  but I think time and I think place is one aspect I mean if I can I didn't ask him if
[2716.18s -> 2721.70s]  I could talk about him but like talk about Jeff Garmeier for example like people I saw people
[2721.70s -> 2726.74s]  were pulling up his like because he's finished four times and have like pulled up his yearly
[2727.70s -> 2731.78s]  time every single year it's like it's an incredible progression
[2732.34s -> 2738.66s]  but I don't think that that's really that indicative of I don't think he was more
[2738.66s -> 2744.34s]  successful this year than other years obviously obviously I can't speak to him or I can't
[2744.34s -> 2751.86s]  speak to his experiences but I think time and what you place in a race is just one perspective
[2751.86s -> 2757.94s]  of how successful a run can go like if I run if I run coca-dona in 65 hours and have a
[2757.94s -> 2763.38s]  miserable time versus if I run coca-dona like that first year Jeff I think ran it in like
[2763.38s -> 2768.90s]  96 hours or something like that but if he had a better time that's more successful of a run
[2768.90s -> 2772.26s]  like I don't give a shit about your time I don't care I don't care about your place
[2772.90s -> 2780.10s]  if you had if you had like a better experience and a better time for 96 hours than you did in 68
[2780.10s -> 2787.06s]  hours or whatever he ran it in it's like and so I'm not trying to take that completely away
[2787.06s -> 2793.14s]  I'm just saying like your time is only one aspect of how successful your run is or how
[2793.14s -> 2798.18s]  successful your run can be yeah and running coca-dona super fast may not be your goal
[2798.18s -> 2805.22s]  that year may not be anyone's goal it was my goal this year for sure and like so I tried
[2805.22s -> 2812.74s]  to run it as fast as I could so I think I had a little bit less fun but yeah and again not
[2812.74s -> 2817.06s]  trying to speak for Jeff I have no idea how he feels about his experiences out there but
[2818.66s -> 2824.74s]  like I still like you know the first year I ran it in 72 hours and it's like
[2825.70s -> 2830.74s]  but did I have a better experience like I don't know I had a very different experience
[2830.74s -> 2835.22s]  so I would also argue that the first couple years of any event but especially an event
[2835.22s -> 2840.10s]  like coca-dona it's more an expedition and you're more figuring out the endurance piece
[2840.10s -> 2845.54s]  of it and maybe 2024 was the first year we really dabbled in speed and that's what was the
[2845.54s -> 2851.78s]  big differentiator this year you know I think so yeah I mean with all races and with all
[2851.78s -> 2856.26s]  fkt's you see these like big jumps right and I think this year was a jump
[2858.58s -> 2863.70s]  and I think it was a good jump I think that like I think the course record this year is
[2863.70s -> 2870.98s]  a lot more indicative of an actual course record than other years like I think breaking
[2870.98s -> 2877.46s]  60 hours is is always good it's always gonna I don't I don't know if we'll see any like
[2878.42s -> 2882.50s]  I mean I say that there's always jumps so like you know coca-dona will get faster
[2882.50s -> 2890.50s]  and it's like yeah um yeah we'll see the the last thing I want to say on the competitive
[2890.50s -> 2894.98s]  mindset piece and I'd love for you to weigh in on this too and I should also stay for
[2894.98s -> 2901.78s]  the record that while I love what has been produced from relatively unwell human beings
[2901.78s -> 2906.50s]  obviously you want them to be healthy and you because the other whatever 20 hours of the day
[2906.50s -> 2910.90s]  matter just as much and it seeps into family life friends etc but like it's crazy to think that
[2912.02s -> 2918.26s]  you know Michael Jordan never happens if if he has access to like regular mental health therapy
[2918.26s -> 2922.50s]  the entire 90s Seattle grunge movement like stone temple pilots and sound garden
[2923.30s -> 2929.54s]  none of that stuff happens if it's taking place in 2020 so like what does sport look like what
[2929.54s -> 2935.54s]  does a culture look like what does music look like yeah I'm glad you brought up art
[2935.54s -> 2940.42s]  because I think art and music has suffered in this generation as well I think so I think that
[2940.42s -> 2945.38s]  they're I mean as far as like my perspective and just like being in the like under court
[2945.38s -> 2951.06s]  underground like music scenes and maybe this is me just being an old guy and being like oh
[2951.06s -> 2955.78s]  fucking kids you know or whatever it's like but it does seem like there's a little bit
[2955.78s -> 2963.46s]  less of like underground music like scenes just in general like um and I so I think
[2963.46s -> 2967.46s]  what's really interesting about you know people talk a lot about social media and people talk about
[2967.46s -> 2975.78s]  a lot about a lot about like the current state of the human condition or whatever and I think
[2975.78s -> 2982.26s]  I don't you said you're how old are you like 35 I'm 32 so like I would the way I was raised
[2982.26s -> 2986.66s]  was like good art comes from embracing like the dark side of life if that makes sense
[2986.66s -> 2996.66s]  yeah so I think I think even the six years between us is a pretty dramatic six years
[2996.66s -> 3000.98s]  because I mean that's like my generation is like I think millennial it's like the last
[3000.98s -> 3007.78s]  generation to not have the internet growing up yeah so it's like um when I was a teenager like
[3008.34s -> 3013.54s]  like and I again I think this is a pretty dramatic difference between me and you like when
[3013.54s -> 3017.70s]  I was a teenager we didn't have cell phones we didn't have the internet so like we spent we
[3017.70s -> 3023.06s]  were the last generation to be bored essentially and I think boredom is what leads to like good
[3023.06s -> 3029.54s]  art and so or like good anything like good skateboarding good sports like good like you
[3029.54s -> 3035.14s]  just become obsessed with playing guitar or doing anything and it's like and being in
[3035.14s -> 3037.62s]  bands and going skateboarding it's because you're fucking bored and you don't have
[3037.62s -> 3043.06s]  anything else to do and so like and I think that I think to take that even further
[3043.86s -> 3051.46s]  it was the last generation that we had to pour all of our energy into creating things to not
[3051.46s -> 3058.50s]  be bored and I think not only do kids today and and generations today not have to do that
[3059.46s -> 3064.82s]  they have to pour all of their energy and it has to be a very intentional like
[3065.78s -> 3074.18s]  decision and practice to create boredom so it's not just that they're not bored is that it takes
[3074.18s -> 3081.62s]  in a huge amount of energy and effort to remove all of that and and and get it out of the way
[3081.62s -> 3086.82s]  just so you can have a canvas to even like start playing guitar or start doing anything
[3086.82s -> 3092.02s]  other than being constantly entertained the entire time so and I think that that is a huge
[3092.10s -> 3099.38s]  fucking deal I think that that's a really crazy thing and I mean and yeah I actually
[3099.38s -> 3102.66s]  don't even remember why we're talking about this but I but I think that like
[3104.02s -> 3110.82s]  I think that that is one thing why trail running attracts so many people especially
[3110.82s -> 3115.14s]  in today's world or why the sport is blowing up in general is that people always ask me if I
[3115.14s -> 3120.50s]  like listen to music or podcasts while I run and it's like like I'm like I'm obviously
[3120.50s -> 3124.82s]  obsessed with music like I mean I have like a band room behind me and I make you know I've made
[3124.82s -> 3129.86s]  music my whole life and I like I love music but like I never listen to music or anything while
[3129.86s -> 3135.22s]  I run because running is like my meditation running is my quiet space running is when I
[3135.22s -> 3139.78s]  turn everything off and it's like or even like the night before coca-dona people are
[3139.78s -> 3143.22s]  always asking me it's like oh like are you nervous are you like ready and it's like no
[3143.22s -> 3148.58s]  like running is the easy part you know it's like I get to go out and just shut off and
[3148.58s -> 3152.90s]  be turned off from the world for three days and it's like physically that that might suck at
[3152.90s -> 3157.86s]  certain points but it's like it's like a super privileged thing that we get to do is just like
[3157.86s -> 3161.78s]  go run around in the wilderness and be shut off from the world around us for a little
[3161.78s -> 3165.94s]  while and it's like and I think that's why the sport is exploding right now is because
[3165.94s -> 3170.74s]  like people like you don't necessarily get that in other sports you know what I mean like
[3170.74s -> 3175.70s]  even something like rock climbing like it's pretty social activity and it's like I mean
[3175.86s -> 3180.74s]  need somebody to climb with and it's like you're anyways but it's just like other activities you
[3180.74s -> 3186.66s]  don't necessarily get things you don't get that like quiet space for 12 hours a day
[3186.66s -> 3191.70s]  you know what I mean and that's really attractive to people and it's why a lot of us
[3191.70s -> 3200.46s]  run and it's why a lot of us gravitate towards continuing to run and yeah what was
[3200.46s -> 3206.22s]  the question? Well we were talking about just what happens to the state of competition and
[3206.22s -> 3214.78s]  art and literature etc when people have grown up with mental health being a priority.
[3215.50s -> 3219.66s]  Yeah but I think in the same way like going back to the being reactionary
[3220.38s -> 3224.54s]  you know comment I think that there are a lot like I actually have some friends who are like
[3224.54s -> 3232.62s]  18-20 years old and they seem to be a lot more well adjusted to the whole like
[3233.26s -> 3237.74s]  internet social media thing they're like because I think it's reactionary now
[3237.74s -> 3242.14s]  I think it's like kind of counterculture to like not be on Facebook not be on Instagram
[3242.70s -> 3246.46s]  and I think that there's a lot of people that are choosing to do that now and sort of shut
[3246.46s -> 3251.26s]  themselves off to it so I mean culture is always you know culture is repetitive and
[3251.26s -> 3258.14s]  culture is cyclic and you know generations swap up and down with things they go back and
[3258.14s -> 3265.10s]  forth and it's the nature of things but it's like yeah I think that there are you know there are
[3266.38s -> 3271.18s]  and this is true just of like human history like there are there are eras and periods of
[3271.18s -> 3276.06s]  like art history you know that are like really productive and then there are other
[3276.06s -> 3280.06s]  eras that are like not so productive for whatever reason whether that be religion or
[3280.06s -> 3284.70s]  whether that whether that be like today it's social media probably it's like social media
[3284.70s -> 3292.14s]  I think is the number one killer of art in today's world and it's like so I mean things
[3292.14s -> 3295.90s]  different things can exist and I mean I mean that's something too is like there's just a
[3295.90s -> 3300.62s]  lot of new forms of art that like maybe I don't give the same respect that I do to like
[3301.34s -> 3306.70s]  playing in bands or something or whatever just because again like the medium I'm the yeah like
[3306.70s -> 3312.86s]  I'm the older generation like talking shit about the way kids are doing stuff or whatever
[3312.86s -> 3318.14s]  so I think that there probably is more than what even I realized but I'm just like not plugged
[3318.14s -> 3327.18s]  into it so but yeah wait maybe slightly moving on from from coca-dona because I know this was
[3327.18s -> 3330.30s]  your last year running I'm sure you'll be involved in some capacity in the future but
[3330.30s -> 3335.58s]  you're done running it from what I can tell generally speaking do things kind of lose
[3335.58s -> 3340.70s]  their magic quickly for you like do you does novelty wear off fast like talk about sort
[3340.70s -> 3346.38s]  of how you think about your interest in events and projects and yeah how you find the next thing
[3347.26s -> 3357.10s]  yeah I mean I would very generally I would say yes I actually I think we said we were going
[3357.10s -> 3360.86s]  to move on but I think coca-dona like coca-dona is the only race I know that I've run
[3361.42s -> 3370.30s]  multiple times like that I don't get a lot out of like running the same races every year
[3370.30s -> 3375.26s]  doing the same thing I'm actually surprised that I've continued to trail run for so long
[3375.26s -> 3380.70s]  to be totally honest I have a lot of other interests and I have a lot of other things
[3380.70s -> 3390.93s]  that I do and so like what like when when I leave trail running or when I leave at least
[3391.97s -> 3396.53s]  in the way that I do it you know like I'm I'm a I've agreed to be like a public figure
[3396.53s -> 3400.61s]  I've agreed to be a sponsored runner you know what I mean and so it's like when you make
[3400.61s -> 3406.21s]  that sort of handshake deal you make certain like you have to give certain things you know
[3406.21s -> 3410.61s]  and play the game a little bit but like when I when I'm done with trail running in that aspect
[3410.61s -> 3416.85s]  it's like um it's going to be very easy for me like I don't have a lot of like
[3417.65s -> 3423.49s]  like I have a lot of other things that I wish that I did do that I that I I'm sort
[3423.49s -> 3428.29s]  of just waiting for this trail running part of my life to be over and I'm like excited
[3428.77s -> 3434.45s]  to do other things so it's like um I'm and I guess I just say all of that to say like I am
[3434.45s -> 3441.33s]  surprised that I've done it for as long as I have um but there's clearly something about it
[3441.33s -> 3447.01s]  that brings me back and keeps me engaged in the sport um to the point again where I'm like
[3447.57s -> 3452.45s]  I clearly care about the direction of the sport and and what's happening in our sport
[3452.45s -> 3462.69s]  right now and um but yeah I mean it's generally my in anything I do I don't like music I have a
[3462.69s -> 3467.73s]  hard time actually like the hardest part of making music for me is actually like the final
[3467.73s -> 3473.73s]  like orchestration and like production of something like I can sit around and play guitar
[3473.73s -> 3479.09s]  for days and write a hundred riffs and like I was like oh that's like that's really fucking
[3479.17s -> 3483.73s]  cool and then just move on from it you know what I mean like I really like the creative side of
[3483.73s -> 3489.81s]  making music and not so much the craft side of making music or you know actually creating
[3489.81s -> 3494.29s]  the final product but or with rock climbing like I've never like project like I've never
[3494.29s -> 3498.93s]  been a sport climber I've never like I never like project something like I every almost
[3498.93s -> 3504.45s]  everything I climb like I climb once and on the first you know it's like you know so it's
[3504.45s -> 3513.01s]  like it's just I don't I sort of I like to experience as much as I can the athletic
[3513.01s -> 3516.85s]  fitness side of all of these endeavors I mean it's like it's a nice side product but it's
[3516.85s -> 3522.85s]  never been a motivator for me it's like um not that there's anything wrong with like
[3522.85s -> 3528.85s]  people who are motivated by being fitness like it's it's great I think I think anyone who does
[3528.85s -> 3537.73s]  anything in today's world I sort of have an admiration for um like the bar is pretty low
[3537.73s -> 3543.09s]  I would say like like like if you do anything in this world other than like watch the news and
[3543.09s -> 3551.01s]  like talk shit about people it's like I I have an admiration for you so it's like I think um
[3552.13s -> 3556.29s]  yeah movement just in general however that makes sense to you or however that
[3557.25s -> 3565.01s]  I think the more you move the more you are alive you know and you don't have to run 250 miles so
[3565.01s -> 3571.25s]  you know it's like I think just being a part of stuff like that I think is is admirable in
[3571.25s -> 3577.73s]  today's world and so yeah is anything interesting to you from a from a race or a project
[3577.73s -> 3584.21s]  standpoint in the next six to 18 months or are you like just totally satisfied and maybe
[3584.37s -> 3590.61s]  at this point just thinking about no um I I mean I think my race I think Saddles is like this
[3592.37s -> 3596.93s]  Saddles is really unique because it has a lot because Saddles has so much support from
[3596.93s -> 3604.93s]  Satisfye running and from Air Viper running that Saddles never Saddles never needs to make
[3604.93s -> 3610.05s]  money like there's no real there's no real point to Saddles ever making money Saddles
[3610.05s -> 3615.09s]  sort of just exists there for myself and for Breeze the owner of Satisfye and for Jamil to like
[3616.21s -> 3620.37s]  like it's almost like this like test piece it's like well what could we do
[3620.37s -> 3625.49s]  at races like and so like we all just sit here like and this is like Jamil was texting me
[3625.49s -> 3629.89s]  asking me about like Air Viper's involvement in Satisfye and I just told him I was like look
[3629.89s -> 3635.25s]  my my dream scenario is that this becomes mine yours and Breeze's just sort of like pet
[3635.25s -> 3640.21s]  project where like we sit around and think about what we could do at a race for like eight or nine
[3640.21s -> 3645.25s]  months and then we sort of enact it and like see how that goes and it's like just and just
[3645.25s -> 3650.53s]  do like weird shit and like explore what it means to be a race and explore explore the
[3650.53s -> 3655.01s]  things that you can have involved in a race and as long as like 100 people sign up it's
[3655.01s -> 3660.05s]  like I think that's enough for like to sort of experience all of that and like experiment
[3660.05s -> 3664.45s]  with things so I mean I think that gives me excitement that gives me excitement to like sort
[3664.45s -> 3669.01s]  of see what Saddles becomes because I have no idea what that could become or what that could
[3669.01s -> 3674.29s]  look like and maybe that's just another 100 miler like on the on the you know but but
[3674.29s -> 3678.61s]  maybe it's not maybe some like cool shit happens well what were you testing what were
[3678.61s -> 3682.45s]  you testing last year at Saddles like what was like your hypothesis about how a race should
[3682.45s -> 3688.45s]  be run or what should be included stuff like that um I think last year was a lot of like
[3689.25s -> 3695.81s]  maybe more on the marketing side like can you have a race in today's world where the race director
[3696.69s -> 3703.33s]  posts two posts on social media about it mostly just like talking shit like like like not
[3703.33s -> 3707.73s]  seriously but like just like sort of like you know like I think in one of my posts I was
[3707.73s -> 3713.65s]  like this is not a qualifier for like Leadville UTMB or Western States like I don't have a
[3713.65s -> 3719.25s]  fucking qualifier so it's like there is no qualifier you know what I mean or or no I think
[3719.25s -> 3722.85s]  I don't even remember what I said it was like those races can't be used as a qualifier for
[3722.85s -> 3727.17s]  Saddles and everyone was like well what is that what you know what is the qualifier then
[3727.17s -> 3731.33s]  I was like there's not one that was just me talking shit you know I was like uh so I was
[3731.33s -> 3738.05s]  like uh yeah and just like the whole the whole atmosphere around the race and just and
[3738.05s -> 3743.09s]  just everything about it and like can you still have an event today a successful event
[3743.81s -> 3749.97s]  whereas like this is a shitty race this is a shitty grassroots like like
[3751.25s -> 3755.41s]  we don't know what we're doing that was actually I was like I was actually thinking like if I ever
[3755.41s -> 3761.57s]  got around to posting something for this year's race uh like I was just gonna say like just so
[3761.57s -> 3765.17s]  everyone knows like we are doing the race this year and for those of you who are bummed about
[3765.17s -> 3770.45s]  missing the inaugural year like we guarantee this year will be just as shitty it's like
[3770.93s -> 3776.37s]  like we we've learned absolutely nothing like don't worry you know and it's like so I think
[3776.37s -> 3780.61s]  the whole like motto of that year was to like under promise and over deliver you know I think
[3780.61s -> 3785.97s]  a lot of runners who ran last year thought there were gonna be like some like gels thrown
[3785.97s -> 3791.73s]  in the dirt for aid stations you know and it just turned out that like Jamil wanted to help
[3791.73s -> 3796.85s]  out so like I went down like there were like real aid stations and like they did timing for
[3796.93s -> 3801.01s]  free just because they're he's a nice guy you know and it like it sort of turned into a real
[3801.01s -> 3807.57s]  race but yeah I think I think a shorter answer is I can't yeah like kind of what I said can
[3807.57s -> 3814.13s]  you have a race today in today's world have it be a successful race but still sort of lean into
[3814.13s -> 3823.09s]  that uh you know 1970s 1980s feel of a trail run where it's just a bunch of people like
[3823.09s -> 3829.01s]  getting together and someone drawing a line in the sand with their toe and saying go and
[3829.01s -> 3834.05s]  shooting a gun and go and you know or whatever like or lighting a cigarette to you know
[3835.73s -> 3840.85s]  take from Laz you know on that or it's like and so like can you and and I think again I
[3840.85s -> 3845.01s]  think the answer to that is like clearly yes you can like saddles and not saying that
[3845.01s -> 3850.05s]  saddles is on like the same sort of level as like the Wasatch or the Barclays but I
[3850.13s -> 3855.09s]  think that there are still there are still markets in this world that sort of lean into that
[3855.09s -> 3861.89s]  older way of doing things yeah um and yeah and then on top of that like I think so my friend
[3861.89s -> 3867.25s]  Matt and I so I've been working for vacation races in Utah for a long time since Matt Matt
[3867.25s -> 3876.45s]  Gunn on the races um and uh after Matt left and after everybody left um I sort of stayed
[3876.45s -> 3881.33s]  on as this like third party trail marker or whatever um but a lot of stuff is happening
[3881.33s -> 3887.49s]  at that company and my friend Matt not Matt Gunn obviously but my other friend Matt uh and
[3887.49s -> 3893.49s]  I have decided to take over those ultra marathons for next year and have like kind of total
[3893.49s -> 3901.81s]  autonomy with those races and completely change those races and um sort of it it's
[3901.81s -> 3908.05s]  an opportunity for me to sort of like see Matt Gunn's vision into fruition uh which I think is
[3908.05s -> 3913.41s]  really important to both myself and a lot of other people that knew Matt and appreciate
[3913.41s -> 3919.33s]  sort of his vision so um yeah and that's actually news I haven't told that to anybody
[3919.33s -> 3927.65s]  or um so we're uh I'm effectively taking over the Zion Bryce and Antelope Canyon races and
[3927.73s -> 3932.45s]  I'm going up owning it purchasing it no it will still be for vacation races but we're
[3932.45s -> 3937.09s]  bringing we're we're bringing back the Ultra Adventure branding and Ultra Adventures will
[3937.09s -> 3944.37s]  exist sort of as this like autonomous branch of vacation races um and a lot of that has to
[3944.37s -> 3953.38s]  do with just like me working out things with the owner of vacation races and just um both of
[3953.38s -> 3960.50s]  us coming to understandings about what all this means and and I do think that he I he has he's
[3960.50s -> 3964.98s]  done some things in the past that he's learned from and he doesn't want to do those things
[3964.98s -> 3971.38s]  anymore and he also I mean to be fair even after Matt passed he was the one he was the
[3971.38s -> 3976.10s]  only one at the company that was really trying to like keep Matt's stuff alive
[3977.46s -> 3982.10s]  and I think I think him hiring me to take over the races is a clear example that he
[3982.18s -> 3988.58s]  also shares those values a little bit so um you know it'll it'll be it'll be a bit of an
[3988.58s -> 3995.06s]  experiment I mean I know him very well so I I mean there's there's that so um yeah I mean
[3995.06s -> 4004.02s]  we're excited about it to sort of change the change the direction of those races and and like
[4004.02s -> 4009.14s]  I said bring back maybe some of the older races that Matt had and because the idea of
[4009.14s -> 4013.22s]  those races were to sort of step up the grand staircase throughout the year is like they'd
[4013.22s -> 4018.18s]  progress they'd progress from early on in the year and you're going like Monument Valley to
[4018.18s -> 4024.02s]  Antelope Canyon like up to the Grand Canyon to Zion to Bryce like well you know Capitol
[4024.02s -> 4028.82s]  Reef you're going up to the Tushers like Bryce Canyon and so it's like climbing the grand
[4028.82s -> 4033.22s]  staircase throughout the year and that was sort of Matt's vision with a lot of those races
[4034.02s -> 4038.66s]  yeah and just turning them back to the yeah so well I mean we'll see how that goes like
[4038.66s -> 4043.94s]  I don't know if it'll be successful I think it will be because um I wouldn't have agreed to
[4043.94s -> 4048.42s]  it unless there was a lot of communication and conversations that have taken place but
[4049.38s -> 4054.26s]  that's going to be actually yeah it's going to be the closest thing I've ever had to a job
[4054.26s -> 4060.82s]  to be totally honest um and you're in your race director era yeah stereotypically the
[4060.90s -> 4069.06s]  aging ultra runner um it's actually so actually my goal uh with those races is to get them back
[4069.06s -> 4075.70s]  to what we all envision that they could be and should be I think um both a vision that
[4075.70s -> 4079.62s]  like Matt Gunn and I shared together like before Matt passed you know we were all
[4079.62s -> 4084.26s]  working on like a stage race through the grand staircase and it's like we have certain
[4084.26s -> 4089.22s]  visions for things and again like I said earlier this is my opportunity to turn some
[4089.22s -> 4098.50s]  of his races into that and um like my but I think best case scenario is the other Matt
[4098.50s -> 4104.02s]  who's who's coming on as co-director with me um I sort of just want to exist in this
[4104.02s -> 4109.06s]  co-director role for as long as I can get those races to that point and any new races
[4109.06s -> 4114.18s]  that we create um will also share that value and I would really love for the new Matt to
[4114.18s -> 4121.70s]  take over um in a year or two as full-time director of those races and and I sort of step
[4121.70s -> 4128.58s]  back to just being the dirty trail marker again because that's what that's what I like to do so
[4129.38s -> 4134.50s]  through your efforts Matt's efforts is it is it likely that we'll see another great
[4135.30s -> 4141.30s]  southwest located multi-day event in the next couple years like you mentioned this stage race
[4141.30s -> 4148.34s]  possibly like could we see like a coca-dona 2.0 in southeast Utah or northeast Arizona
[4151.58s -> 4161.57s]  you could I think the the 200 mile distance for races feels like a lot
[4163.25s -> 4169.09s]  200 plus miles so I think I I can't I can't never say never I can say that there's no
[4169.09s -> 4175.25s]  there's no real plan unless I have a conversation with Steve Alderholt yeah uh
[4175.97s -> 4180.93s]  about bringing Matt's there so like Steve was involved in that stage race planning as well
[4182.13s -> 4189.49s]  uh I think now with like that's not the grand to grand is it no okay no this was totally
[4189.49s -> 4196.29s]  separate Matt had just barely opened registration uh before he passed and it was he wasn't even
[4196.29s -> 4201.65s]  taking money from people at that point it was just like a sign up thing it was in a very
[4201.73s -> 4207.17s]  yeah it was something totally different but it was actually at Matt's memorial run Steve put on
[4208.21s -> 4212.77s]  a segment of that where a bunch of people came out and ran like a segment of what that race was
[4212.77s -> 4218.45s]  going to be um so I mean I could see some conversations there happening with Steve and
[4218.45s -> 4223.01s]  some other people about whether or not we wanted to bring something like that back or or
[4223.01s -> 4230.05s]  not even bring it back just actually do it um there's just a fucking lot right now man
[4230.05s -> 4238.21s]  and it's like um yeah there's just a lot going on so and then I mean my relationship was
[4238.21s -> 4244.13s]  satisfied you know I I mean I think I have the greatest deal in ultra running and um
[4244.13s -> 4248.85s]  I can't say enough positive things about them both as a company and as people like they're
[4248.85s -> 4255.65s]  just I just love all of them so much and I'm I feel like the luckiest guy alive to be able
[4255.65s -> 4261.41s]  to be in the situation that I am with them and um so I don't know what that looks like I
[4261.41s -> 4265.41s]  don't know what the future holds for my relationship with them and and the projects
[4265.41s -> 4271.17s]  that we'll get into um but you know I'm going to continue to be with them for as long as
[4271.17s -> 4277.17s]  they'll have me which I you know I think they like me too so uh it's like I think
[4277.17s -> 4281.65s]  I think there will always be projects there will always be things as far as like competitively
[4281.65s -> 4290.00s]  racing like you know I I really do think that the you know the 200 plus mile distance is the
[4290.00s -> 4296.16s]  only distance I can compete in these days anyways so um it's like I'm probably not going to do a
[4296.16s -> 4301.04s]  whole lot of those either so it's like uh I don't know about competitively running but
[4301.04s -> 4306.56s]  there will always be cool projects that I'll continue to do is satisfy and um gotta you know
[4307.76s -> 4312.40s]  the the daughter's like a year at 11 months old so once she gets a little older we'll
[4312.40s -> 4320.00s]  start doing some more stuff too but um you know just and this is just me being interested in
[4320.00s -> 4326.00s]  tracking trends and subcultures and movements but like you you very clearly represent like
[4326.00s -> 4330.40s]  sort of the the anti-corporate pro athlete image and then on this race directing front
[4330.40s -> 4337.52s]  whether or not it's intended like saddles to me represents like the the zag to the zig of
[4337.52s -> 4343.20s]  what's going on with you know you can be in the golden ticket series and so you know I'm sure you
[4343.20s -> 4346.88s]  have a lot of thoughts there but I'll just be curious to see not that one is going to win or
[4346.88s -> 4354.24s]  lose but I'll be curious to see how much traction in the community your version of
[4354.24s -> 4359.92s]  ultra running gets because yeah like there's I don't know to me it's just that that's going
[4359.92s -> 4364.32s]  to be one of the exciting I don't even want to call it a cultural battle but like it'll
[4364.40s -> 4372.08s]  I'll be curious to see where things are in 2030 you know in that regard I do think that that
[4372.96s -> 4382.77s]  like golden series utmb thing I think all of that um this whole image that ultra running has
[4382.77s -> 4388.05s]  on like a large-scale image and you obviously would probably know about this better than I
[4388.05s -> 4393.81s]  would but it's like I I think that's actually the minority you know what I mean I think even
[4393.81s -> 4400.21s]  people running these like like even like these super hyper competitive events like black canyon
[4400.21s -> 4407.09s]  like utmb or something the reality is that there's only like three to five percent of
[4407.09s -> 4412.29s]  those runners out there think they can be competitive you know like the other 95 percent
[4412.29s -> 4416.29s]  of the runners aren't out there trying to beat anybody or they're not out there like maybe
[4416.29s -> 4421.25s]  they're trying to like get top 10 or top 20 or whatever it was like those are some goals
[4421.25s -> 4426.85s]  people have but I think the majority of people who ultra run or trail run are out there for
[4426.85s -> 4434.05s]  the experience and are out there for like the growth that they could achieve from that and
[4435.41s -> 4441.09s]  the mental side of running the psychological side the mental health side like all those
[4441.09s -> 4445.73s]  other things all those other reasons that people run the competitive side is only
[4446.61s -> 4452.45s]  an a part of a very small percentage of ultra runners but publicly the perception is that
[4452.45s -> 4458.69s]  like that is the entire sport that the the hyper competitive people the sponsored athletes
[4458.69s -> 4463.73s]  and and the reality is that it's because the only reason why any of that exists is because
[4463.73s -> 4468.93s]  these companies have identified the market of trail running is now big enough that they can
[4468.93s -> 4476.37s]  pour money into sponsoring athletes the social media program the marketing departments like blah
[4476.37s -> 4483.65s]  blah blah like and turn yet another one of our outdoor activities into a marketing campaign and
[4483.65s -> 4489.89s]  a consumer market and but that's not the reality of most ultra runners I think I think
[4489.89s -> 4496.85s]  most of us are out there not because like you know because of the clothes or the shoes
[4496.93s -> 4503.81s]  or because of whatever we're all out there for the experience and I think that trail running
[4503.81s -> 4507.97s]  I think what I love so much about it is the fact that you really don't need anything you
[4507.97s -> 4512.69s]  don't need to go buy anything to go trail run like go to the thrift store and get a pair of
[4512.69s -> 4516.61s]  shoes and a pair of shorts and you have everything you need to go like experience that
[4516.61s -> 4521.89s]  activity and I think the fact that these companies like Hoka and Solomon and some of
[4521.89s -> 4527.17s]  these other bigger companies have been able to turn trail running into a consumer market I think
[4527.17s -> 4533.49s]  is an impressive marketing like scheme but I also think it fucking sucks so like it's like I
[4533.49s -> 4540.37s]  don't like and that's been a big thing about like sponsorships at saddles or like sponsorships
[4540.37s -> 4546.77s]  for the races in Utah now we've already cut out every corporate sponsor at the
[4546.77s -> 4551.25s]  vacation races races because like we don't want them around and we don't want their shitty
[4551.25s -> 4555.97s]  vibes like we don't want people showing up to our races thinking that this is just an opportunity
[4555.97s -> 4561.17s]  for these brands to press like push product on them or we don't want we don't want runners to
[4561.17s -> 4565.97s]  feel like they're coming around simply because we're trying to sell them a product like these
[4565.97s -> 4571.49s]  are not these are not ad campaigns these are not like come out for the experience and like
[4571.49s -> 4578.37s]  fucking experience the run in the community as much as you can and again the fact that these
[4578.37s -> 4587.12s]  bigger companies have been able to convince people that like you know I don't want to call anybody
[4587.12s -> 4592.32s]  help personally so I'm not going to but but the the that some of these professional athletes like
[4592.32s -> 4599.36s]  are trail running it's like it's bullshit like yeah like we're all trail running the non-sponsored
[4599.36s -> 4604.32s]  athletes are trail running but not the like the people who are like like buying shit at
[4604.32s -> 4609.04s]  thrift stores and going out and running and getting an experience and like those are trail
[4609.04s -> 4613.68s]  runners and like that's the community and I think like and you know you've brought up like
[4613.68s -> 4618.32s]  the whole like counterculture thing a lot and to like kind of segue back into that conversation
[4618.32s -> 4623.68s]  like like I don't think I'm the counterculture I think I am the culture I think those other
[4623.68s -> 4628.96s]  hyper competitive sponsored athletes they're the fucking counterculture all the d1 college
[4628.96s -> 4634.24s]  athletes coming out and trying to like crush these fucking record times that's the counterculture
[4634.96s -> 4638.80s]  like I am like people like me
[4641.04s -> 4645.44s]  non-competitive like I guess like I can't I don't even think I'm a good representation
[4645.44s -> 4650.88s]  like I'm a sponsored runner you know like I'm I am what I fucking hate but it's like it's like
[4652.00s -> 4657.36s]  it's like I think like I think all that other stuff that exists in trail running like that's
[4657.36s -> 4662.72s]  trail running so like you can dress up the top 10 or whatever and you can do all this stuff
[4662.72s -> 4666.72s]  to try and sell shoes to people or to try and do whatever like you want to as a
[4668.16s -> 4672.64s]  ceo of these big companies because just because you've identified that there's a big enough trail
[4673.44s -> 4678.64s]  trail running market that you can now extract from instead of actually support like that's
[4678.64s -> 4682.48s]  what that's why we're doing away with the corporate sponsors at the races in utah because
[4682.48s -> 4687.60s]  like you can still sponsor our event but the only way you can sponsor our event is you have
[4687.68s -> 4693.60s]  to come yeah you can't send me you can't send me a few boxes of like back orders that you can't
[4693.60s -> 4698.88s]  sell and expect me to like hang your banner everywhere and like give you a bunch of like
[4698.88s -> 4705.76s]  content like the only way you can sponsor our events and is like not to like toot my own
[4705.76s -> 4711.84s]  horn here but like with satisfy running at coca dona they come from france spend like
[4711.84s -> 4716.80s]  tens of thousands of dollars and like build this big aid station at coca dona and try
[4716.80s -> 4721.84s]  and provide the runners with it whether you like it or not it's a different experience
[4721.84s -> 4726.48s]  and they're at least coming and supporting the event all these sponsors like just like here's
[4726.48s -> 4732.64s]  some money like do a bunch of marketing for us like fuck that like not interested like you
[4732.64s -> 4737.28s]  have if you want to sponsor any of our events you have to come you have to send people and
[4737.28s -> 4741.36s]  you have to actually support the event and be a part of the community if you're not willing
[4741.44s -> 4746.32s]  to do that then like fuck off like go sponsor western states or something
[4748.16s -> 4752.96s]  and but but for the record you know and none of what i'm gonna ask you is gotcha and my
[4752.96s -> 4758.00s]  opinions are fairly fluid but i i have a hard time believing and i can totally see this on
[4758.00s -> 4761.60s]  like wall street for like if you're working for like a private equity firm or like if you're
[4761.60s -> 4766.64s]  like a bond trader i i totally get that like you are well aware that sort of like your
[4766.88s -> 4772.64s]  existence and the economy is less about value creation and service and more extractive but
[4772.64s -> 4778.72s]  i have a hard time believing that somebody applies to a company like hoca or utmb and then
[4778.72s -> 4782.80s]  like wakes up every day being like can't wait to extract value like i have to imagine that
[4782.80s -> 4789.04s]  those jobs those companies are so um like you're not no one's making it totally rich
[4789.04s -> 4794.40s]  right like even like i just have a hard time believing that like their mode of operation
[4794.48s -> 4799.20s]  is extraction i could be wrong again like i don't i don't know the the financials or the inside
[4799.20s -> 4802.96s]  baseball you have more experience being on the ground no i i think sometimes yeah no i agree
[4802.96s -> 4808.24s]  with you i i think sometimes i just like pick on them because like you know they're like an
[4808.24s -> 4813.52s]  easy it's like low-hanging fruit a little bit and it's like yeah um but i but i do think
[4813.52s -> 4817.92s]  like i mean anytime i can like sort of pick on hoca i do because i think that they're like
[4817.92s -> 4821.92s]  the main sponsor of like the whole everything that's going on with like the utmb thing
[4821.92s -> 4826.08s]  and like iron man getting into our sport and like all the all of those controversies which
[4826.08s -> 4834.08s]  we don't need to talk about here um but yeah so i think too just like seeing like you know i
[4834.08s -> 4838.16s]  was in the sport when they were a new brand so it's like seeing what they've become is like
[4838.16s -> 4844.32s]  funny to me and it's just like so i and and i think it's clear i'm not like picking on
[4844.32s -> 4851.36s]  the individuals either but i do think that like there are there are a lot of these bigger
[4851.36s -> 4857.28s]  companies have you know there are certainly people that work for them that have like good
[4857.28s -> 4861.36s]  motives and and they do really great things and i think that even those companies sometimes
[4861.36s -> 4866.32s]  can do really great things but i also think that like i ran kodiak last year which i'm
[4866.32s -> 4871.76s]  not really sure why and and i think it's a cool course that loop around that lake at high
[4871.76s -> 4875.60s]  elevation i mean that's sick so it's like it's why i mean i think it's why it was
[4875.60s -> 4879.52s]  always on my radar is like a course that i wanted to run and it's like running through
[4879.52s -> 4886.72s]  those aid stations it's like like how are your aid stations worse than the aid stations i had
[4886.72s -> 4895.04s]  at saddles yeah but there's 500 huge hoka lights like going up all the ski resorts and there's
[4895.04s -> 4900.48s]  like hoka banners everywhere and you're like spending six figures on like hoka advertising
[4900.48s -> 4905.20s]  i'm making shit up now you know what i mean but it's like it just seems like there's a
[4905.20s -> 4911.60s]  lot more going into the production of the of the marketing and the ads than there is actually
[4911.60s -> 4916.16s]  going into helping the runners or having good aid stations or like having a good course and
[4916.16s -> 4922.24s]  it's like i think that races need to kind of get away from that i think like this this idea
[4922.24s -> 4926.24s]  that i think so i think i think a big push there is and that's where i agree with you
[4926.24s -> 4930.32s]  though i i agree with you there because and i don't mean to interrupt but like i totally
[4930.32s -> 4935.68s]  believe in like the hippie dippy energy field type stuff and you can totally tell when a race
[4935.68s -> 4940.08s]  has been built and operated from a position of love versus like just going through the motions
[4940.08s -> 4944.88s]  and like i hate my job but like my job is to mark the course today or to set up an aid station
[4944.88s -> 4950.00s]  you can totally tell when somebody has like phoned it in versus like they cannot wait to
[4950.00s -> 4955.60s]  do all of like the miniscule and like setting up the porta potties because they just love the
[4955.60s -> 4960.96s]  race and what it stands for like i totally buy that and so to me when i think about what makes
[4960.96s -> 4967.68s]  like a race like saddles more vibrant and like community driven than maybe one of these utmb
[4967.68s -> 4972.96s]  races is that undeniably everything that has been built at saddles comes from a position
[4972.96s -> 4978.40s]  of love whereas maybe in the case of kodiak one of the employees on the ground like
[4978.40s -> 4982.24s]  doesn't really like their job doesn't want to be there and so like things kind of fall
[4982.24s -> 4986.56s]  apart from that standpoint but it's less extractive in my opinion yeah no i agree with all that i
[4986.56s -> 4991.60s]  think i think too a lot of times like i take on the position of like i'm needing to be the
[4991.60s -> 4997.20s]  extremist like in the other direction you know what i mean so like to push back on all of that
[4997.20s -> 5001.60s]  as much as i can because sometimes i feel like i'm the only one doing it even though like
[5001.60s -> 5005.12s]  clearly i'm not i feel like sometimes maybe i'm the only one publicly doing it
[5005.84s -> 5013.68s]  and it's like uh which also isn't true but like uh yeah so like everything i say you know what i
[5013.68s -> 5018.48s]  mean like everything i say is like i don't even like i i like to say sometimes like you know
[5019.12s -> 5025.52s]  i have a lot of like values and opinions and i don't believe in any of them so um it's like
[5027.76s -> 5031.76s]  i'll go ahead sorry no it's just like sometimes like if i if i if i'm picking
[5031.76s -> 5036.16s]  on a company like hoka like what i'm actually picking on is like the worst case scenario
[5037.04s -> 5044.40s]  and using them because they're an easy one to pick on or it's like um but yeah that what i
[5044.40s -> 5048.64s]  think what's awesome is that like i mean i mean a big reason of why i continue to come back
[5048.64s -> 5054.00s]  to the sport and like still be involved in it is because like i get along with more people
[5054.00s -> 5058.88s]  in the trail running community than i do in any other community so it's like like when i'm
[5058.88s -> 5063.76s]  out there running coca dona is like i'm probably the most talkative i ever am in my entire life
[5063.76s -> 5067.04s]  while i'm out running if there are like other runners around because it's like
[5068.40s -> 5072.00s]  it's just like a bunch of people you kind of get along with which like you drop me
[5072.00s -> 5076.56s]  into any other setting in this world that's not the case you know so it's like i actually
[5076.56s -> 5081.36s]  really do like like most people in trail running i just i just again it's going back
[5081.36s -> 5085.60s]  to the same thing we've been talking about is like as i get older i'm just getting less
[5085.60s -> 5092.72s]  tolerant of things and when i see races turning into like these big like it just feels like it's
[5092.72s -> 5099.12s]  more about the product that they can sell versus the experience it's like i i have a hard time
[5099.12s -> 5103.52s]  like not calling that out and like not saying something about it i mean even like you know
[5103.52s -> 5107.12s]  like i'm i'm good friends with jamil it's like i've been friends with jamil for a long time
[5107.12s -> 5111.20s]  and i've been involved with arabipa for a long time like i don't love what's happened
[5111.20s -> 5121.04s]  to black canyon city you know it's or like the black like it just like um and that's and that's
[5121.04s -> 5129.04s]  like that's such a small there's so much worse things it's like it's just me being like really
[5129.04s -> 5134.64s]  nitpicking idealistic you know what i mean and so it's like almost everything i say or do is like
[5135.60s -> 5142.80s]  is like you know i like i like everyone else alive am absolutely a hypocrite like i like
[5143.52s -> 5147.76s]  i think everyone alive is a hypocrite i think this idea that we're all like living these like
[5147.76s -> 5153.84s]  perfect ideal versions of ourselves is not true i mean i think that we have we all have that
[5153.84s -> 5160.88s]  sort of ideal version of ourselves that we aspire to be and we all falter in being that
[5160.96s -> 5166.08s]  and and where where we falter is how we're we're all hypocrites and i think that that's totally
[5166.08s -> 5170.56s]  fine i think the goal is to try and like minimize that as much as possible but like
[5170.56s -> 5174.80s]  yeah i'm a huge hypocrite with things like i talk i talk about things all the time and i don't
[5175.44s -> 5180.72s]  fulfill like i ran kodiak last year it's just a utmb race it's like how can i fucking sit
[5180.72s -> 5186.32s]  here and say you know and it's like like i'm going to utmb next year because satisfy wants
[5186.32s -> 5192.64s]  to put up a fucking tent and they want it's like okay you know so it's like i think it's
[5192.64s -> 5197.52s]  just i think it's all like innocent conversations but i do think that like
[5198.64s -> 5202.96s]  because they're extremists pushing in the other way i feel the need to push back a little bit
[5202.96s -> 5207.84s]  and i mean i think that's a good why like i just feel like saddles just needs to exist
[5207.84s -> 5212.80s]  just for the sake of that you know what i mean like there just needs to be not saying
[5212.80s -> 5217.36s]  that there aren't other races that also exemplify that but just knowing that saddles will always
[5217.36s -> 5225.20s]  exist as this like we are the extremist on this side of the spectrum it's like that just
[5225.20s -> 5230.40s]  needs to exist just for the sake of it you know it's like 100 and i i hope you know that
[5230.40s -> 5235.44s]  i deeply appreciate like that role of being a check-in balance on anything that you perceive
[5235.44s -> 5240.96s]  as either off or or wrong and i'll be the first of it too that i've i've on more than
[5240.96s -> 5245.60s]  one occasion been a hypocrite and it's also super easy for me to sit on this side of the mic
[5245.60s -> 5251.68s]  lobbing questions and comments and what ifs at you so um no i and i think for me too it's like
[5251.68s -> 5256.32s]  it's always important to realize that it's just like trail running it doesn't fucking matter or
[5256.32s -> 5261.68s]  it's like it's we're all just like running around like and so i mean i do think a
[5261.68s -> 5268.72s]  common thing with me my whole life is like i've like always harped on like sort of like
[5270.24s -> 5277.36s]  extreme consumerism and turning everything into products and and just buying things for the sake
[5277.36s -> 5284.00s]  of buying things and i think that you know when i when i see that world again similar to like
[5284.00s -> 5289.36s]  the david goggins mentality or like the hyper like consumerism aspect of trail running creeping
[5289.36s -> 5295.84s]  into my sport like i kind of i kind of react and i'm like fuck stop like like even though
[5295.84s -> 5304.40s]  i have no fucking you know sway over anything like like yeah solon's not gonna like anyways
[5304.40s -> 5310.24s]  stop picking on brands last question on this topic i promise and i guess it's more a
[5310.24s -> 5313.60s]  comment first because you and i are both basketball fans you probably hate me for this
[5313.60s -> 5318.88s]  but i'm a big jazz fan so i'll go to a couple games a year always go to whatever
[5318.88s -> 5322.72s]  it's called the vivant smart home arena and like i see that logo i see all the branding around the
[5322.72s -> 5328.40s]  stadium my my reaction is always like yeah like whatever and like i go watch the game and
[5329.36s -> 5334.88s]  i can still enjoy the mba and the hyper professionalism of it and like find time to
[5334.88s -> 5340.88s]  you know go to like a local ymca club and and play pickup or whatever and whatever you know
[5340.88s -> 5346.32s]  what i mean but then like in my home sport of trail running you know you and i can sort
[5346.32s -> 5350.96s]  of have this dispute about like the validity of like hoka pylons being on the course and that
[5350.96s -> 5354.08s]  totally ruining the vibe and threatening the sport like what are your thoughts there because
[5354.08s -> 5358.72s]  again you and i both love the mba and i don't feel like either of us see the existence of
[5358.72s -> 5366.16s]  the mba hurting like the grassroots pickup style that happens you know in your local home but i
[5366.16s -> 5370.40s]  i do think me being into the mba is is an example of how i'm kind of a hypocrite
[5371.12s -> 5375.36s]  because i i mean i mean maybe hypocrite's too strong of a word but like like being
[5375.36s -> 5379.28s]  into professional sports doesn't really like go in line with everything else that i'm talking
[5379.28s -> 5384.40s]  about but it's actually an interesting question and it was because yesterday i was driving home
[5384.40s -> 5389.12s]  from brice canyon and i was i have to drop my friends off that i hire in vegas for their
[5389.12s -> 5398.32s]  flights back and and i drove past the raiders stadium and uh they had like on the big screen
[5398.32s -> 5402.64s]  right on the interstate they had like a picture of their quarterback friend like in
[5402.64s -> 5407.52s]  the 1970s or whatever it was like they were just like showing pictures and stuff and it's like
[5408.48s -> 5413.36s]  and i was like what about the current raiders is and this is true of any team that moves
[5413.36s -> 5419.76s]  locations right like what makes a team a team and and the reality is that like the marketing
[5419.76s -> 5425.92s]  and the brand is all that that is i mean even ownerships change you know what i mean so like
[5427.04s -> 5430.96s]  or it's like to bring up the phoenix suns because i'm a big phoenix sun or i've been
[5430.96s -> 5434.80s]  since a suns fan my entire life like the suns went to the finals two years ago
[5435.52s -> 5439.92s]  and then after that year they traded every single player except for devin booker
[5441.52s -> 5444.64s]  and like had a new coach and had like everything and it's like it was almost
[5444.64s -> 5447.76s]  like devin booker got traded to a new team but they're like in the same spot
[5448.88s -> 5452.96s]  and so it's like what makes a team a team and why are we have fans of these teams especially
[5452.96s -> 5458.80s]  if they move locations like how is anyone in las vegas proud of the history of the raiders
[5458.80s -> 5465.36s]  you know what i mean or like and so i and i think you know what's interesting is that like
[5465.92s -> 5470.56s]  all that it is is like i said the only thing that makes a team a team is the brand and is
[5470.56s -> 5476.24s]  the marketing and is the logo and is the like phoenix suns pillow that i have you know
[5476.24s -> 5485.36s]  somewhere it's like and like why are we why do we continue to be fans of it like especially
[5485.44s -> 5491.28s]  in the cases if that team moves i don't know it's like it's an interesting it's just an
[5491.28s -> 5496.08s]  interesting i don't i don't know if this will make your cut cutting room floor or whatever
[5496.08s -> 5500.64s]  but it's like well it's an incredibly as someone who is a sports fan and that doesn't
[5500.64s -> 5504.24s]  think as critically about all of that it's incredibly destabilizing to now entertain that
[5504.24s -> 5510.56s]  so um might have ruined my jazz fandom well i mean yeah i mean the jazz are from new orleans right
[5510.88s -> 5519.52s]  yeah but i mean no i'm i was thinking about like sometimes besides the the branding sometimes
[5519.52s -> 5526.00s]  it's the owner right the owners will own this team for like 40 years or the owner's family
[5526.00s -> 5529.92s]  you know like the lakers have been owned by the same family for however long family yeah and
[5529.92s -> 5534.08s]  it's like uh so like even if the lakers move obviously the lakers aren't going to move but
[5534.08s -> 5538.24s]  even if they moved somewhere else like that would still be owned by them so besides the
[5538.24s -> 5543.92s]  marketing and branding we're just fans of these like hyper wealthy like
[5545.84s -> 5552.40s]  fucking family is it like is that what i'm a fan of like like like why am i staying loyal to
[5553.52s -> 5556.96s]  any of it because it's just i don't know anyways
[5559.20s -> 5562.64s]  do you have not saying not not saying you shouldn't be a jazz fan or i shouldn't be a
[5562.64s -> 5568.48s]  sons fan i mean i shouldn't be a sons fan because they're fucking toxic and shitty but uh like
[5570.16s -> 5575.84s]  yeah i mean there's something there you know and that's like you know brands and symbols
[5575.84s -> 5581.60s]  and all of those things and like that that does matter and in human psyche so it's like
[5583.76s -> 5588.08s]  you know again i'm i'm a sponsored runner so i'm the biggest hypocrite out there it's like
[5588.08s -> 5592.96s]  you know i like given that's not like a traditional setup but it's still it's like
[5593.60s -> 5599.12s]  you know i've i associate with my brand and it's like and that that's a big part of like what
[5599.12s -> 5603.04s]  barice and satisfy talk about like with their whole culture and what like they're trying to
[5603.04s -> 5608.56s]  develop is like because they similar were like part of like punk rock things growing up and
[5608.56s -> 5615.20s]  it's like you as a human being you latch onto these onto these brands or onto these
[5615.20s -> 5624.08s]  symbols because it identifies that like you're you are a part of this or in in a lot of cases
[5624.08s -> 5628.72s]  with like counterculture things it's like you're saying i am not part of this and it's
[5628.72s -> 5634.40s]  expressing and communicating that like you don't share these values and you think that these
[5634.40s -> 5641.60s]  values are detrimental to whatever um and i mean maybe not with like sports but we're
[5641.60s -> 5647.20s]  still like when you wear a jersey of like a sports team you're saying that like i am a part
[5647.20s -> 5655.60s]  of this community and like we have shared values at least in this moment and in this time
[5656.56s -> 5661.28s]  like what we're all like sitting here watching the jazz game and i think that those things are
[5661.28s -> 5665.92s]  important for people like people finding communities it's like i said earlier is like
[5665.92s -> 5672.08s]  when i meet people that like i like i sort of latch onto and a lot of times like i remember
[5672.08s -> 5677.68s]  i was i remember last time i was in paris barice the owner of satisfy was getting me to go
[5677.68s -> 5682.72s]  running with some of his friends and it's like friends that i had never met friends that i
[5682.72s -> 5687.04s]  didn't know i just had their phone number we were just texting to like meet up and we'd meet
[5687.04s -> 5692.48s]  up in these public places and i'd run right over to him because every fucking guy who wears
[5692.48s -> 5697.28s]  satisfy looks exactly the same you know what i mean it's like we're all like like we're all
[5697.28s -> 5701.36s]  like clear like they're all like covered in tattoos and it's all like counter you know it's
[5701.36s -> 5706.08s]  like like i didn't have to ask like what he looked like or where he was i just like saw him
[5706.08s -> 5710.40s]  and i was like oh there's ian like let's go running you know what i mean so it's like those
[5710.40s -> 5717.04s]  things do provide opportunities for us to like you know come together as a community and and do
[5717.12s -> 5722.24s]  all this and i think all of that too i mean like with trail running when you're out like on a
[5722.24s -> 5727.52s]  trail in your local community and you see somebody wearing like a vest it's like oh
[5727.52s -> 5731.76s]  you're like a trail runner like you're an ultra runner right that's like that's how you're
[5731.76s -> 5736.24s]  identifying yeah that that's what you're putting that's those are the feathers that you're
[5736.24s -> 5741.28s]  putting out there to like like be a part of this community and there's nothing wrong with
[5741.28s -> 5748.64s]  that you know there's absolutely nothing wrong with that and yeah and maybe that's hypocritical
[5748.64s -> 5754.40s]  of me to say after all the other shit i've talked to well and again maybe this is i don't
[5754.40s -> 5758.40s]  know if it's a stereotype but one of the vibes i've always gotten is that if you're
[5758.40s -> 5763.04s]  involved in the counterculture to some extent you almost want to defy labels and i do think
[5763.04s -> 5768.88s]  it's actually cool in this day of age to take ownership in some sort of group identity or a
[5768.88s -> 5774.56s]  brand so like in my experience or with my perspective i have i take no issue with somebody
[5774.56s -> 5781.68s]  being super hyped about adidas or nike or la sportiva yeah or or satisfy what i care most
[5781.68s -> 5786.48s]  about is like can you really tell that they are passionate about it and they take ownership in
[5786.48s -> 5792.96s]  it and they they live sort of the ethos and the values yeah i mean that's that i mean
[5792.96s -> 5797.04s]  that's the most important thing like i can talk about all these like esoteric philosophical
[5797.04s -> 5806.96s]  ideals of like branding in the sport but like the like the idea of me like not expressing
[5806.96s -> 5811.60s]  like respect or kindness to somebody because they're in like a solomon shoes or something
[5811.60s -> 5818.88s]  or like that's that's fucking insane right like like i like like i like i generally like
[5818.88s -> 5822.64s]  most people that i meet in trail running and it has nothing to do with what they're wearing
[5823.52s -> 5830.64s]  and i think that is more in line with like what i'm what i'm like trying to get across is that
[5830.64s -> 5837.28s]  like all of these all this entire community this entire world of trail running is about those
[5837.28s -> 5842.24s]  better things it's about the kindness in the in the i mean it's why we run races right because
[5842.24s -> 5848.48s]  of the community it's like there's literally no other point to running a race besides like
[5849.36s -> 5854.32s]  maybe some support to like get something done that you want to get done which you could set
[5854.32s -> 5858.80s]  that support up on your own really the biggest thing is the community to like run these run
[5858.80s -> 5864.24s]  these things on the same day as everybody else and so it's like as long as i think everyone's
[5864.24s -> 5870.64s]  like being awesome to each other then the sport is fine um and the sport is fine like
[5870.64s -> 5874.64s]  the sport's fine it's just it's just like curmudgeons like me sitting back and like
[5874.72s -> 5879.92s]  identifying ways that it can like should be or it sure shouldn't be and it's like
[5880.64s -> 5884.88s]  which i think is important to have that a little bit you know to sort of like keep some
[5884.88s -> 5890.08s]  things in check but um like as long as we're all just like running and like having
[5890.88s -> 5898.32s]  good experiences and who cares about anything else outside of the people at satisfy are there
[5898.32s -> 5906.64s]  any other people in the community that you would identify as i don't i don't want to say
[5906.64s -> 5911.44s]  ally because that kind of sounds like a cringe term but just people who see the sport the
[5911.44s -> 5915.60s]  same way you do and want to act as like a check and balance on certain trends like
[5915.60s -> 5918.72s]  are there people that you're like i don't even know if colleague is the right word
[5918.72s -> 5922.88s]  but do you know you know i'm going with this like who do you talk with the most that has
[5922.96s -> 5928.96s]  a similar level of influence maybe that i like i like the smaller brands you know like i mean i
[5928.96s -> 5934.48s]  can say on an individual level there's like everyone yeah you know it's like i don't i
[5934.48s -> 5939.12s]  don't hold any individual accountable for anything it's like i just think that there are
[5939.12s -> 5943.76s]  trends and when none of us have real control over trends it's like it's sort of just move and
[5943.76s -> 5948.88s]  exist in this weird ethos above everything but it's like or like culture we don't really
[5948.88s -> 5954.88s]  control that but like so like i mean again it's why i said i still run races because most of the
[5954.88s -> 5959.36s]  like most people i meet are races are awesome you know it's very it's very rare that we get
[5959.36s -> 5964.08s]  the like guy yelling to aid station workers in our sport you know what i mean it's like
[5964.96s -> 5969.12s]  almost like 99 percent of people who exist at these races and do these things they're all
[5969.12s -> 5975.12s]  awesome and it's like that's why we continue to be a part of this community because it like
[5975.68s -> 5980.56s]  the shitheads get weeded out pretty fast and it's like like there's no tolerance for that
[5980.56s -> 5985.44s]  right like there's no tolerance for again to use the example of like the guy yelling to aid station
[5985.44s -> 5992.24s]  volunteers so it's like um on a brand level like i just like clearly i'm a guy that like
[5992.24s -> 5997.20s]  supports smaller brands and like smaller brands doing cooler things like i think jng is a really
[5997.20s -> 6001.12s]  cool brand i think the people that they support and and the stuff that they're doing
[6001.12s -> 6005.52s]  like i really respect i think that there's a lot of brands like that that are i think even the
[6005.52s -> 6010.08s]  bigger brands do cool stuff you know at times like these bigger brands don't exist in the same
[6010.08s -> 6016.08s]  way that like i am a hypocrite and i just like try and be the best version of myself that i can
[6016.08s -> 6020.64s]  i think brands can exist like that too like there are a lot of different aspects of brands
[6020.64s -> 6025.76s]  and a lot of different people working for brands so it's like um i mean satisfy is
[6025.76s -> 6030.56s]  doing i don't know if i'm allowed to say this never mind no they did it came out satisfy
[6030.56s -> 6036.08s]  did a collaboration with hoca you know yeah so it's like there are mutual and that wasn't me
[6036.08s -> 6041.28s]  like obviously i'm not i'm not satisfied but like it's like there's a lot of overlap that
[6041.28s -> 6048.72s]  can happen and there's a lot of cool things and there's like um so i you know i don't
[6050.08s -> 6056.72s]  like yeah i guess just to say like most of the sport and most of the things brands do
[6056.72s -> 6063.92s]  i support and i respect and i think is like really awesome it's just the like it's just the
[6063.92s -> 6069.44s]  extractive elements that i see which which i don't really like like i think sometimes you can
[6069.44s -> 6076.96s]  tell when things are like done by like the marketing department of companies or if they're
[6076.96s -> 6083.44s]  done by like actual trail runners you know and it's like yeah i just i think that we can
[6083.44s -> 6087.84s]  it's good to recognize those things and i mean because it can get shitty
[6087.84s -> 6093.92s]  you know what i mean and and i think i think i think iron man and the whole thing that happened
[6093.92s -> 6101.20s]  with gary and all of that i think getting exposed was was um obviously you know sucks for
[6101.20s -> 6105.36s]  gary and it sucks for all the people involved in that company up there but i think that like
[6106.48s -> 6112.24s]  there are shitty things that can happen when we start leaning into this hyper and this is
[6112.24s -> 6117.28s]  between like we talked a lot about the hyper competitive competitiveness between runners
[6117.28s -> 6123.04s]  and athletes but that also exists between brands and and i think that stuff like what
[6123.04s -> 6128.00s]  happened to gary can happen is when you get a bunch of people who are only in the sport
[6128.00s -> 6133.44s]  because they're trying to make as much money as they possibly can um can have detrimental
[6133.44s -> 6140.08s]  effects to local trail running scenes and i and i think gary's example going as public
[6140.08s -> 6147.20s]  as it did i i'm hoping that like long term can be good for the sport because i mean people tend
[6147.20s -> 6152.64s]  to generally forget about that stuff pretty fast you know and move on from it but but i'm
[6152.64s -> 6158.32s]  hey we're still talking about it in may yeah or at least i am right it's like uh but it's like
[6158.32s -> 6163.84s]  i do think i i do think having such a public example of where that type of mentality
[6163.84s -> 6169.84s]  and branding and these bigger brands moving into our sport can have serious consequences
[6170.32s -> 6177.12s]  and can have detrimental effects to like you know in the same way like rei just moved into my town
[6177.12s -> 6181.68s]  and it's like press kit has known for its like local outdoor shops and like bike shops
[6182.32s -> 6187.68s]  and it's like it's the model it's like rei moves in they spread the market thin enough to
[6187.68s -> 6193.28s]  where the smaller shops can't withstand it but a big huge thing like rei can they put everyone
[6193.28s -> 6198.24s]  out of business and then now they're the only player in the game it's like it's the oldest
[6198.32s -> 6204.40s]  it's the oldest model there is in like like american corporate economics and it's like
[6205.36s -> 6210.40s]  so just resisting that you know resisting iron man coming in and pushing out local
[6210.40s -> 6214.96s]  trail running scenes and it's why i like jamil so much that's why i like arabipas so much
[6214.96s -> 6220.56s]  because jamil's jamil is now big enough and arabipa is now big enough that they can resist
[6220.56s -> 6226.16s]  companies like utmb and when utmb tries to come in and buy black canyon and buy javelina and
[6226.16s -> 6231.60s]  jamil says no like arabipa is too big for utmb to push out right you know and so it's like
[6232.88s -> 6240.00s]  there are serious consequences to brands getting too big and existing for the sole purpose of
[6240.00s -> 6246.48s]  extraction and making hundreds of millions of dollars it's like now i know that that's not
[6246.48s -> 6251.68s]  the case in like most communities like most communities are like or with most brands even
[6251.68s -> 6258.48s]  you know what i mean like but i do think it's a cautionary tale yeah and it's something and
[6258.48s -> 6264.80s]  it's something that exists in almost every other sport that that has happened in almost
[6264.80s -> 6269.52s]  every other outdoor sport like why the fuck is adidas one of the biggest like rock climbing
[6269.52s -> 6273.68s]  sponsors why is nike one of the biggest skateboarding sponsors it's like these
[6273.68s -> 6279.20s]  brands have moved in taken over and it's like these are cautionary tales that we can
[6279.20s -> 6284.00s]  either choose to listen to or not with our precious trail running because we're at that
[6284.00s -> 6291.52s]  crossroads you know i think you mentioned jamil i think jamil is one of the best examples of
[6291.52s -> 6297.12s]  somebody who threads the needle perfectly in his core sport like actually preparing for
[6297.12s -> 6302.88s]  this interview i rewatched his interview that he did with you uh post arizona trail i'm like
[6302.88s -> 6306.24s]  he lets you riff on like jonathan livingston seagull for like 10 minutes
[6308.24s -> 6313.68s]  yeah no i've always i've always talked about jamil about he's he's he's one of the most
[6313.68s -> 6320.08s]  interesting people i know in the sport because he has his foot in every pot like he understands
[6320.08s -> 6326.24s]  and sympathizes with every point of view with like i mean he like he's a big reason why
[6327.04s -> 6334.64s]  i have a career in ultra running and on the on the flip side of that he also loves like he loves
[6334.64s -> 6339.28s]  utmb and like european races and these like that was like i mean that's like publicly his
[6339.28s -> 6345.60s]  goal with you with coca dona was to turn it into this like like bigger american equivalent
[6345.60s -> 6349.76s]  american equivalent of like these european races you know what i mean so it's like or like
[6349.76s -> 6354.48s]  black canyon city or javelino like he has some of these like biggest ultras out there so
[6354.48s -> 6360.00s]  it's like i think he's just so interesting and how he's like you to use your parlance
[6360.00s -> 6364.72s]  to like thread the needle of all of these different aspects of the sport i don't know i
[6364.72s -> 6368.88s]  think he's a really good person to be in the position that he is and have the influence
[6368.88s -> 6374.96s]  that he does um and i feel i feel thankful for people like him in our sport that are able to
[6374.96s -> 6379.84s]  sort of like see all those points of view and i can spew shit at him like this all night
[6379.92s -> 6385.36s]  and he sort of receives that and sympathizes with all of it and even agrees with a lot of
[6385.36s -> 6391.60s]  it to a certain point and um but he's able to absorb that and like sort of i think it's why
[6391.60s -> 6396.32s]  like he loves supporting saddles and why he loves supporting a lot of other races like
[6396.32s -> 6401.44s]  arabipas supports a lot of races that you wouldn't be you don't really know just because
[6401.44s -> 6405.44s]  they want to see things succeed and i think it's important like that to have people
[6405.84s -> 6411.84s]  um like he's a he's a highly influential person in our community because of all everything that
[6411.84s -> 6417.84s]  he does so yeah i think better him than some other people i know we're we're way over time
[6417.84s -> 6421.52s]  do you mind if i ask you like two or three more questions tops i don't care at all i actually
[6421.52s -> 6426.00s]  so i meant to say to you at the beginning of this if i if i take the time to like sit down
[6426.00s -> 6433.28s]  and talk to somebody like i'm a lot better at the long form stuff anyways because like if
[6433.28s -> 6438.08s]  we're gonna talk about things i don't want to just like get superficial about them and move on
[6438.08s -> 6442.40s]  oh yeah like let's know i respect that let's talk about it you know so yeah i just wanted
[6442.40s -> 6448.40s]  to respect your time i'm having a ton of fun um yeah me too all right i got a i got a i wrote
[6448.40s -> 6452.64s]  a quote down here and it was from an interview that you did with satisfy maybe three years
[6452.64s -> 6457.68s]  ago and i have a lot of questions off of you say building is one of the most creative
[6457.68s -> 6462.64s]  things you can do just because most builders are boring as fuck doesn't mean you can't do
[6462.64s -> 6467.84s]  cool shit with building my first question are builders boring as fuck well i mean i think most
[6467.84s -> 6473.36s]  most like okay it's like generally speaking that like most people who work in construction
[6473.36s -> 6480.88s]  that you know are like they work on like track homes you know like that's like what most
[6480.88s -> 6484.48s]  building is just building track pumps you're just building the same thing over and over and
[6484.48s -> 6490.24s]  over again and i don't think i i don't think the majority of construction workers go to work
[6490.24s -> 6495.76s]  every day feeling like super stoked because they have this like canvas of creativity that they can
[6495.76s -> 6501.84s]  lay into for like the rest of the day again i'm not just speaking out of term here like i've
[6501.84s -> 6506.08s]  worked in construction for a long you know what i mean it's like so i think i think
[6507.36s -> 6516.56s]  and and and i think that that quote was definitely just in general a pretty like
[6517.28s -> 6522.72s]  blanketed metaphor for things you know what i mean i think the way that most people do things
[6522.72s -> 6531.04s]  in general like and and i think um they because you're a builder like you're clearly a builder
[6531.68s -> 6536.72s]  and you're not boring no and i mean i think like when i when i build things like so i've
[6536.72s -> 6541.12s]  been a pretty spoiled builder my entire life because i've gotten to like pick and choose things
[6541.12s -> 6547.04s]  i work on and like you know so i've built like i've built tree houses i've built this house in
[6547.04s -> 6552.56s]  spain out of like trees there's actually pictures of it on my instagram like way back uh it's like
[6552.56s -> 6557.52s]  this really crazy house it'll never be done like you're building like that house like that
[6557.52s -> 6563.36s]  house is fucking insane like uh and or like you know a few years ago i built a couple
[6563.36s -> 6569.12s]  tiny houses and like sold those so it's like i i generally build pretty creative things and
[6569.12s -> 6574.96s]  it's because that's my motivation my motivation with building is to not just like pump units out
[6574.96s -> 6581.68s]  and sell them again it's like i've avoided using this word up until now but i think i have
[6581.68s -> 6588.24s]  to it's like it's not i'm not motivated by like capitalistic ideals and so it's like when
[6588.24s -> 6593.04s]  i build things i'm not motivated by the amount of money that i can get in return for selling
[6593.04s -> 6598.16s]  that or when i start a race i'm not motivated by the amount of money that i can make from
[6598.16s -> 6603.84s]  registrations or you know what i mean so it's like and without getting in to me like talking
[6603.84s -> 6608.40s]  shit about that i like i can just leave it like that like i personally am not motivated
[6608.40s -> 6613.76s]  by those things and i realize that that's an extremely like privileged position to be in
[6613.76s -> 6618.88s]  but it's also just the truth like it's it's just on on my day-to-day level i'm not super
[6618.88s -> 6624.32s]  motivated by things that like i can make a bunch of money at so like and i think that when
[6625.20s -> 6630.24s]  your motivation is money i think you get into building the same house 10 times in a row and
[6630.24s -> 6636.32s]  a really boring uncreative lifestyle and so and so when races are motivated by money i think they
[6636.32s -> 6641.36s]  turn into these big things that like aren't great you know what i mean there's like there's
[6641.36s -> 6645.04s]  not a lot of thought that went into them there's not a lot of community that goes into them
[6645.68s -> 6650.64s]  like there's like why doesn't every race have a fucking kids race on a friday night the
[6650.64s -> 6654.56s]  night before where like parents can pelt their kids with water balloons as they're crossing the
[6654.56s -> 6658.64s]  finish line you know what i mean it's like that was just an example matt and i were
[6658.64s -> 6668.40s]  talking about saddles this year yeah no it's like so it's like um yeah i think anything you
[6668.40s -> 6678.32s]  do can be an incredibly creative enterprise i think um and then there are a lot of people
[6678.32s -> 6683.84s]  who choose to do things just sort of the more general way of doing it like the more successful
[6683.84s -> 6688.48s]  like i think music is a really good example like if you're going to be a musician right like
[6688.48s -> 6695.04s]  really really creative like music probably not going to be that successful like just generally
[6695.04s -> 6700.24s]  speaking you're probably like but if you lean into writing more like commercially successful
[6700.24s -> 6704.00s]  pop music like you're probably going to be more successful and you're going to make more
[6704.00s -> 6709.84s]  money but like that doesn't necessarily mean that again huge generalities here just like
[6709.84s -> 6720.16s]  just saying in general like um so yeah whether that's literally building something and i've
[6720.16s -> 6724.80s]  actually like i think breeze has i think after that interview like breeze actually like sort of
[6726.88s -> 6730.88s]  inherited a little bit of that like with his own brand you know what i mean like how can
[6730.88s -> 6737.20s]  we be different as a brand like like there's a model for how brands exist and how we build
[6737.20s -> 6741.44s]  how you build certain brands and how you get big enough and then you eventually like move
[6741.44s -> 6747.12s]  the mass market and you like do all these other things and it's like how can satisfy like defy
[6747.12s -> 6755.36s]  that in today's world and still be successful and still be like a brand that exists but how do
[6755.36s -> 6759.36s]  we how do we do that differently or how do we do this differently at saddles like there's
[6759.36s -> 6763.44s]  there's the model i mean even with like things like belt buckles you know like like what like
[6763.44s -> 6767.28s]  i don't have to give a fucking belt buckle at saddles if i don't want to like that's just the
[6767.28s -> 6773.76s]  thing they started doing i do get belt buckles at saddles but it's like just just an example
[6773.76s -> 6780.16s]  of like that's a really small example of like we don't have to do anything it's like we can
[6780.16s -> 6784.96s]  do anything that we want and and even though the race format doesn't feel like the most
[6784.96s -> 6791.84s]  creative of like enterprises i think that there are things to explore there you know
[6792.80s -> 6797.20s]  i think it's really admirable that you have at least from what i can tell you've organized
[6797.20s -> 6801.60s]  your life to not be beholden like i learned that you've like never paid rent for 10
[6801.60s -> 6806.80s]  years like you bought land and kind of slowly built up an existence on that land like very
[6806.80s -> 6811.60s]  like you've it is i know you say privilege which i you know privilege is is relative but
[6812.48s -> 6818.16s]  you've done a pretty good job at not having to compromise on a lot of stuff which is cool
[6818.88s -> 6825.60s]  yeah which which i feel really lucky but it's like uh yeah it's like
[6826.80s -> 6832.96s]  i refuse i've i've refused my entire life to pay rent to somebody because i think like
[6835.04s -> 6841.04s]  interest seeking rent receiving landlords should be illegal because i'm super idealistic
[6842.56s -> 6848.96s]  and like so like again that's just like this extreme personal opinion that i have like like
[6848.96s -> 6853.04s]  like rich people that own a bunch of houses shouldn't be charging poor people to live there
[6853.04s -> 6857.92s]  like like just in like without getting into any of the other stuff that's just like how i
[6857.92s -> 6865.12s]  feel so like so because of that i've created this like super idealistic persona where like i
[6865.12s -> 6872.00s]  would rather sleep in my truck on this like cheap land that i bought and learn how to build shit
[6872.00s -> 6877.52s]  over the course of 12 years and build a bunch of shitty things out on my land that were illegal
[6877.52s -> 6882.56s]  that eventually i had to tear down because the county chase like made me tear them all down
[6882.56s -> 6885.68s]  it's like i spent 12 years of my life learning how to build shit
[6887.12s -> 6893.36s]  and now i can do it well and so like now like now i can build a tiny house and sell it
[6893.44s -> 6899.12s]  now i have money and it's like so it's it's like not that that was like the motivation for that
[6899.12s -> 6906.88s]  but it was still like so so i've i've been able to stay really idealistic and i and and i think
[6906.88s -> 6912.24s]  that that is privileged like but i also think i've worked hard at like no like like not a
[6912.24s -> 6916.00s]  lot of people are going to live without electricity for like i didn't have power for
[6916.00s -> 6922.00s]  like eight years yeah you know like i hauled my own water and like which you get used to
[6922.00s -> 6927.68s]  it pretty fast but like but i also like i clearly have electricity now and it's like i have like
[6927.68s -> 6934.24s]  all this stuff and it's like um i actually think i'm like like to most people i'm still
[6934.24s -> 6938.88s]  like probably poor but i also like i'm one of the only friends that i know that own a house
[6938.88s -> 6945.60s]  in our generation you know what i mean like i have a house i bought a house like which is
[6946.16s -> 6952.56s]  insane like i've never had a job you know what i mean and so it's like the like i think a lot
[6952.56s -> 6957.60s]  of it is like i don't want to like i have worked hard and i have done all those things
[6957.60s -> 6963.52s]  but i've also been really lucky and i am i do think i'm privileged whether that's like
[6963.52s -> 6967.84s]  like no one's ever like given me anything but i i do think that i'm just like
[6968.56s -> 6974.08s]  an intelligent white guy and like shit comes easy you know so it's like um
[6975.84s -> 6983.04s]  so yeah it's like and that's that's actually a big part of me continuing to be a trail runner
[6983.04s -> 6988.00s]  and continuing continuing to like have an association with satisfy for continuing to
[6988.00s -> 6993.76s]  do a lot of the things that i do is like like i have these opportunities that are in front of
[6993.76s -> 7003.60s]  me that a lot of people wish they had and like a lot of people strive for and to not
[7004.56s -> 7007.52s]  take advantage of those opportunities feels like a waste
[7008.64s -> 7014.00s]  and so like i mean even on the like you know it's like how i said earlier i think i have
[7014.00s -> 7018.72s]  the best deal in ultra running when it comes for what i'm expected to do which is absolutely
[7018.72s -> 7024.08s]  nothing for satisfy like i like i always talk about how i'm the only sponsored athlete in
[7024.08s -> 7028.40s]  the world that doesn't have social media obligations and i actually found out that that's
[7028.48s -> 7031.76s]  bullshit because arlen for completely different reasons
[7034.08s -> 7038.08s]  also doesn't have social media obligations got a great deal yeah he's got a great deal
[7038.08s -> 7044.24s]  but uh so like it's just continuing my involvement with satisfying continuing to
[7044.24s -> 7050.08s]  be a part of all of that and like or just the home that i live like i'm able to like
[7050.08s -> 7057.28s]  my wife and i are both stay at home parents in a house that we don't pay rent in it's like
[7057.28s -> 7062.88s]  how the fuck did that happen like in today's world when so many people are struggling to like
[7062.88s -> 7070.24s]  buy the shittiest house that they can afford and it's like it's why i'm so hard on landlords
[7070.24s -> 7075.20s]  that's why i refuse to pay rent it's like human being one human being should not own
[7075.20s -> 7082.61s]  40 houses you know it's like sounds like that playbook should go into a book it's like
[7082.61s -> 7087.41s]  maybe you know you wrote that guidebook on grand staircase maybe write a guidebook on
[7087.41s -> 7093.01s]  not paying rent like the playbook for it but again i just think i guess i i think i'm just lucky
[7093.57s -> 7097.09s]  i think i got really lucky i'm one of the few people and so like i'm not one of these
[7097.09s -> 7103.25s]  fucking assholes that talks about how like you know the bootstraps guy you know what i mean
[7103.25s -> 7109.65s]  i think i got really lucky i bought land for twenty thousand dollars and i sold it for more
[7109.65s -> 7118.45s]  than that and i sold two tiny houses yeah and i was able to buy this piece of shit house
[7118.45s -> 7121.97s]  which i've been rebuilding for two years for the last two years
[7125.57s -> 7128.93s]  so it's like it's not like i don't work hard like i work hard for it and it's like
[7130.77s -> 7134.77s]  you know the house still isn't done it's like my wife's bathroom isn't done the staircase
[7134.77s -> 7139.09s]  is just plywood i have like a baby crawling up plywood stairs in the house you know and
[7139.09s -> 7142.53s]  it's like i mean like 80 percent of it's done so it's fine but it's like
[7143.01s -> 7152.53s]  oh do you still have the 68 dodge a 100 i don't no i sold it really yeah we shouldn't do that
[7152.53s -> 7155.57s]  because there was a time in my life i didn't have any money and i needed some money
[7157.09s -> 7168.59s]  gotcha and yeah and it was just like uh i couldn't take it anywhere man like i was
[7168.59s -> 7172.99s]  just watching one of your az tv i think you were using that van at the time of the az t
[7172.99s -> 7176.75s]  right because there were some cool shots that jamil got of like the inside of it and when i was
[7176.75s -> 7183.31s]  sweet i think that might have been the whiskey man movie okay but uh it was like a deadhead
[7183.31s -> 7190.11s]  van yeah so the guy i bought it from had owned it for like 50 years and uh i remember
[7190.11s -> 7194.75s]  when he sold it to me he came out to my place that's also in the whiskey man movie and
[7194.75s -> 7200.27s]  like we hung out in that van for like three days and i didn't i don't smoke pot which i
[7200.27s -> 7204.67s]  know is surprising to everybody but like i don't like i've never smoked pot uh well that's not
[7204.67s -> 7211.15s]  true when i was younger i did but i don't and so like he just had to like he like i play guitar
[7211.15s -> 7215.15s]  and he's like played harmonica you know so like he had to come out to the land stayed out
[7215.15s -> 7220.51s]  there for like three days it's like 85 year old guy like on my property like sitting in his
[7220.51s -> 7226.99s]  van just like smoking and like drinking and like playing music for like days and then when
[7227.07s -> 7232.75s]  it was finally like over he like he sold me the van and it was like that was it
[7234.59s -> 7241.23s]  but yeah like sorry just uh the yeah the guy who had it before me like had
[7241.23s -> 7247.95s]  all the decorations in there and everything um were were because of him yeah
[7249.47s -> 7254.75s]  that might surprise some people that you don't touch marijuana but you're very familiar with
[7254.75s -> 7261.47s]  psychedelics especially psilocybin yeah yeah pot to me is way crazier than psilocybin like
[7261.47s -> 7270.83s]  like just the way it affects me it's um uh yeah psilocybin that's i i think it's funny i mean
[7270.83s -> 7277.47s]  i mean psilocybin can obviously be insane but like also if you drink an entire bottle
[7277.47s -> 7281.15s]  of whiskey like that's gonna be pretty fucking insane so it's like i mean that's one thing
[7281.15s -> 7286.11s]  so like i have a bunch of chemistry degrees i actually used to teach chemistry yeah community
[7286.11s -> 7292.43s]  college and prescott and you learn pretty quickly in chemistry that you know like there's
[7292.43s -> 7296.83s]  like a famous axiom about chemistry i'm gonna get it wrong exactly how it goes but essentially
[7296.83s -> 7302.27s]  it's like nothing in this world is poisonous or not poisonous or like nothing in this world
[7302.27s -> 7306.11s]  is good for you or bad for you it's just a matter of dosage you know and so like
[7307.55s -> 7310.83s]  even something like smoking cigarettes like i don't think tobacco is bad for you
[7311.31s -> 7314.91s]  i think smoking a pack a day is bad for you you know what i mean i think like
[7315.63s -> 7320.67s]  i don't think alcohol is bad for you i think like drinking a 12 pack of beer is bad for you
[7321.79s -> 7327.39s]  you know microdosing psilocybin is like the tamest fucking thing you could ever experience
[7328.43s -> 7334.35s]  doing an entire like ziploc bag full of mushrooms is fucking crazy yeah so it's like
[7334.35s -> 7340.51s]  it's just whatever relationship you have with that and um but for me what i can say with
[7340.51s -> 7346.83s]  pot it doesn't seem like the dose matters at this point like i feel like when if i even like
[7348.11s -> 7352.27s]  with pot i actually got made fun of the other day for calling it pot because it's like this
[7352.27s -> 7360.35s]  old guy term or whatever anyway uh uh it's like something happens to me psychologically when i
[7360.35s -> 7366.67s]  when i like the relationship that i have with that plant something switches in my brain when
[7366.67s -> 7372.19s]  i engage with it and it it's bad it's not good yeah so i just can't touch it at all
[7373.31s -> 7378.83s]  um which i was actually speaking to just bring up jeff browning again too because he uses it a
[7378.83s -> 7386.19s]  lot and uh uh we were talking about because his wife is similar to me like she can't
[7386.99s -> 7395.07s]  she can't even barely engage with it and um i think i i think one thing i said to jeff
[7395.07s -> 7402.11s]  was like well i think like i think how i am sober is how like is what it does for people
[7402.11s -> 7406.83s]  like jeff like jeff is like all over the place and just like his mind is going a thousand
[7406.83s -> 7409.71s]  miles an hour all the time and for i think people a lot of people that
[7411.31s -> 7416.59s]  it like there's this like calming that happens yes and this like able to like sort
[7416.59s -> 7421.15s]  of sort your thoughts a little better i think the way that i talk and the way that i think
[7421.23s -> 7426.51s]  about things is like how most people do when they're like super stoned anyways so like for me it
[7426.51s -> 7431.31s]  just like sends me into this like hyper fucking it just doesn't work for me i don't know it's
[7431.31s -> 7436.99s]  like yeah but no i totally agree like clearly i mean looking at me or like hearing me talk
[7436.99s -> 7442.99s]  i should smoke pot all the time but i don't so it's just one of the stereotypes of the
[7442.99s -> 7449.39s]  long hairs you know um for sure but uh but but mushrooms are performance enhancing for you
[7451.31s -> 7456.43s]  that's yeah that i that's such a good question every time he gets asked it's a great question
[7456.99s -> 7465.07s]  because it's just such an interesting conversation um and the my my usual first response to that
[7465.07s -> 7473.07s]  question is i think mushrooms can be but won't be i think for like i think for like the
[7473.07s -> 7482.43s]  marathon 50k distance i think mushrooms can be performance enhancing wow um i think for
[7482.43s -> 7488.51s]  anything longer than that it it absolutely is not one thing that happens at least for me is
[7489.07s -> 7493.39s]  like so i took i actually took some mushrooms at the beginning of coca-dona this year
[7493.39s -> 7498.59s]  because i actually hadn't touched mushrooms in probably two years and then and then the week
[7498.59s -> 7505.23s]  before coca-dona this year um i wasn't super stoked about some things that were happening with
[7505.23s -> 7511.71s]  my like mental health like type stuff and so i was like well maybe i'll revisit that and see
[7511.71s -> 7516.27s]  i do think i have this sort of like reputation of like running around on mushrooms all the time
[7516.27s -> 7520.75s]  and i think the only reason why that exists is because i i talk about it quite a bit like
[7520.75s -> 7527.55s]  openly um but i actually don't like like like i said i hadn't touched mushrooms in like two
[7527.55s -> 7534.35s]  years until a few weeks ago um and i microdosed a couple times and then the morning of the race
[7534.35s -> 7540.91s]  i did similar to what i did the first year like a a hefty dose at the beginning uh that
[7540.91s -> 7545.87s]  wears off by about like hour five for six or something like that and one thing that happens
[7545.87s -> 7554.27s]  to me is i'm super uninterested in eating or drinking anything um so it's this conscious
[7554.27s -> 7560.99s]  decision i have to make while i'm while i'm experiencing that to eat and drink something
[7560.99s -> 7564.75s]  especially on that first section of coca-dona as you know it's like pretty important to
[7564.75s -> 7574.59s]  drink some stuff and it's like um so i also think what i also think mushrooms are pretty good for
[7576.83s -> 7585.15s]  um at least for myself like stripping away some of those superficial
[7586.59s -> 7591.23s]  things that i can get dragged into you know i mean this year like all the talk about coca-dona
[7591.23s -> 7596.99s]  like the competitive field all the runners me being included in that field for whatever reason
[7596.99s -> 7603.31s]  me being a part of this documentary like i'd be lying to everyone and myself if i didn't say that
[7603.31s -> 7609.39s]  i was sucked into that a little bit you know what i mean like you you feel it and you get
[7609.39s -> 7614.59s]  sucked into it a little bit and it's actually a huge decision why i decided to take mushrooms
[7614.59s -> 7619.87s]  at the beginning of this year at coca-dona is because mushrooms really helped me like
[7619.87s -> 7630.75s]  solidify my motives and my goals and realize how unconcerned i am with those other runners
[7631.87s -> 7636.51s]  other than wishing them the best race that they can possibly have and so that was really good
[7636.51s -> 7641.79s]  for me to like all that build up to coca-dona all the interviews all the the movie the fucking
[7641.79s -> 7649.55s]  live stream all that stuff to like just for myself to like guarantee like like taking that
[7649.55s -> 7654.35s]  that first morning and being out there you know like i hung out and like talked to like mika
[7654.35s -> 7660.11s]  for like an hour like i was like i wasn't i didn't care at all with anybody like i i might
[7660.11s -> 7666.43s]  have talked to you i don't even remember like it's like uh but it's like i just it's it's
[7666.51s -> 7672.59s]  really good for that for me to like clarify motives and so like after like with all the
[7672.59s -> 7678.43s]  bullshit like i said leading up not bullshit but just all the stuff and then just feeling that
[7679.07s -> 7684.75s]  at the start you know and string bean and all like all this and it's like no you know i'm
[7684.75s -> 7689.47s]  actually back here like this is my own thing this is my own race this is my own journey
[7689.47s -> 7694.19s]  i'm going to do the best that i can but that's my own personal experience and like
[7694.19s -> 7699.39s]  if i get to spend time with those guys that's great but it's not why i'm here i'm not here to
[7699.39s -> 7705.23s]  beat those guys so like that's why i did it that's a lot that's a that's a long story to
[7705.23s -> 7712.51s]  say why i did that this year so like i do have a good relationship with psilocybin and um
[7713.71s -> 7718.83s]  it shows up again when not not to be that guy that talks too much about that but uh
[7718.83s -> 7724.03s]  which i talk about all the time so i guess i am that guy but um well i feel like
[7724.03s -> 7728.99s]  psychedelics can be a great like you like it sounds like you were saying there like a great
[7728.99s -> 7734.99s]  conduit to making meaning out of uh chaotic situations and i don't want to put words in
[7734.99s -> 7739.87s]  your mouth or even like interpretations in your mouth but i have to imagine that when you're
[7739.87s -> 7746.11s]  put in that scenario of like being documented and being uh tagged with all these other elite
[7746.11s -> 7751.39s]  runners as competitive and um capable of doing something special on the course that can be
[7751.39s -> 7755.79s]  like pre-traumatic for the race and then of course the race itself can be traumatic right
[7755.79s -> 7759.23s]  like i'm sure there are a lot of people out there that have completed multi-day stuff you've
[7759.23s -> 7765.95s]  done the azt the colorado trail like that shit can be traumatic right absolutely i think
[7765.95s -> 7771.87s]  it's the most traumatic way that you can experience the outdoors um so agreeing to
[7771.87s -> 7780.51s]  be a part of it um you know there it satisfies other parts of our personality and
[7780.51s -> 7787.31s]  our ego and our our motives or whatever it's like when you when you agree to do something
[7787.31s -> 7796.66s]  as fast as you possibly can you're not there for the like you're not having a good time
[7796.66s -> 7801.22s]  you know it's like these aren't enjoyable ways of doing it and in a lot of ways i do think
[7801.22s -> 7806.18s]  that they are the worst way to experience things it's actually why i said like like a
[7806.26s -> 7810.90s]  lot of people talking to me about about how this is my last year running coca donna
[7811.54s -> 7816.10s]  and i think a way of clarifying that is probably like this is probably my last year
[7817.14s -> 7824.42s]  trying to go as fast as i can like i i not not that i don't as as of right now i don't
[7824.42s -> 7829.22s]  want to speak in forever terms when i'm talking concrete terms yeah when i'm talking
[7829.22s -> 7833.38s]  about how i feel right now like as of right now i don't feel like i'm ever going to
[7833.38s -> 7838.50s]  race coca donna again but as of right now there is a part of me that's like in 10 years when i'm
[7838.50s -> 7844.18s]  like looking back on my ultra running career like i wonder if i could do coca donna in 100
[7844.18s -> 7851.54s]  120 hours or something like that or maybe even fuck it like next year like take 120 hours to
[7851.54s -> 7858.34s]  do it have a completely different experience like run 50 miles a day and like go out
[7858.34s -> 7861.62s]  to dinner and like sleep in a bed every night like it's just like a completely
[7861.62s -> 7866.34s]  different experience you know and it's like i have some interest in doing things similar to
[7866.34s -> 7869.86s]  when i finished the arizona trail i mean i don't like in a lot of those interviews it's like
[7870.42s -> 7874.66s]  like people always ask me like what the arizona trail was like i was like i have no fucking
[7874.66s -> 7878.50s]  idea i don't remember any of it and it was the worst possible way that you can experience
[7878.50s -> 7883.30s]  the arizona trail like i have a huge desire to go back and hike the arizona trail which
[7883.30s -> 7888.02s]  i've never done but they're like even even after that i was like i'd like to come back
[7888.02s -> 7892.50s]  and just hike it and actually experience it and like actually like meet people on the trail and
[7892.50s -> 7898.74s]  meet other people hiking it and like because doing things in in the fastest known time or
[7898.74s -> 7905.30s]  trying to win a race they're like like running utmb as fast as you can i mean that was a big
[7905.30s -> 7911.78s]  deal with me at the year i ran utmb i had spent the two weeks prior to utmb climbing
[7911.86s -> 7918.42s]  in the mount block like massive so when the actual race came around i was like super i was like
[7919.30s -> 7924.50s]  why am i why am i going to run through these mountains as fast as i can and just like suffer
[7924.50s -> 7929.62s]  it's like so i just didn't have the right mindset or motivation the year i ran utmb because
[7929.62s -> 7934.18s]  like i had been in those mountains for two weeks you know like experiencing them in a
[7934.18s -> 7949.38s]  very different way and is like uh yeah so like the sorry yeah go ahead well i was just going to
[7949.38s -> 7955.62s]  say going back to coca dona like i know personally as a fan of the sport i'm going to miss
[7955.62s -> 7961.62s]  your presence at that race because uh yeah and i think i think the the movie when it comes out
[7961.62s -> 7965.86s]  is going to achieve sort of like the sentimentality of all that like we're going to look back at
[7966.42s -> 7971.54s]  2024 coca dona the same way you might look at like the mid-90s sons and be like i miss the
[7971.54s -> 7976.02s]  danny angel energy i miss the charles barkley energy like i miss michael verstieg being
[7976.02s -> 7982.50s]  this check on like the super professionalized soulless aspect of of ultra running right like
[7982.50s -> 7989.78s]  in ken his persona and ken his style like in an underdog type way like triumphant come out
[7989.78s -> 7993.62s]  on top and like can we keep trying to run that experiment in subsequent years like okay
[7993.62s -> 7997.70s]  mike learned a lot you know in 2024 like can he come back with that same style but maybe a
[7997.70s -> 8002.74s]  slightly more awareness of what it takes and like beat the field in in a rematch like if
[8002.74s -> 8006.66s]  we run it back for 2025 can can like beat the field like that kind of stuff i'll miss
[8008.42s -> 8013.38s]  yeah and to be totally honest like i'll miss i'll miss being a part of the like i like
[8013.38s -> 8017.38s]  like i've said in some other interviews like i think i'll always be a part of the race i
[8017.38s -> 8021.70s]  think i'll always be present at the race as long as i'm around and i'm in town and like
[8022.34s -> 8029.14s]  can be present at that race like like i said i think my biggest contribution to that race has
[8029.14s -> 8034.74s]  been the lore like we said at the beginning of the interview is like i do think i've created
[8034.74s -> 8043.22s]  helped create some lore around coca dona in a lot of ways i've just like even even i mean
[8043.22s -> 8048.26s]  just the experience i have at coca especially that first day is like when you're around all
[8048.26s -> 8054.66s]  these other runners like runners are stoked to see me and to be around and to run with me and
[8054.66s -> 8058.82s]  to like experience some time and like i feel that especially because i'm on mushrooms so you
[8058.82s -> 8065.94s]  like feel people's like energy and you feel people's like uh you just you just feel that
[8065.94s -> 8070.50s]  it's like very clear and it's like i'm so like i feel so appreciative that i've become like this
[8072.10s -> 8076.74s]  figure at this race you know what i mean that like people are stoked to have around and
[8076.74s -> 8082.58s]  people are you know like i've i've obviously never been able to watch the live stream but
[8082.58s -> 8086.90s]  from what other people have told me is like people like seeing me on the live stream and
[8086.90s -> 8093.94s]  it's like um and i feel all of that like i feel that love and i and i think that that's
[8093.94s -> 8101.38s]  really awesome and i will absolutely miss that um the reality the reality of of me not
[8101.38s -> 8105.70s]  wanting to run coca dona has nothing to do with me not wanting to be a part of the race
[8105.70s -> 8111.78s]  or not wanting to be around those people or not wanting to contribute to it it it solely has to
[8111.78s -> 8118.56s]  do with the fact that like i've done a lot of things that are extremely detrimental to my
[8118.56s -> 8128.42s]  health in the last 10 years in ultra running yeah and just getting to the point where i don't
[8128.42s -> 8135.62s]  know if it's worth it anymore to do these super long things i've never really recovered
[8135.62s -> 8141.22s]  mentally or physically or psychologically or emotionally from the colorado trail experience
[8141.86s -> 8150.26s]  and i don't really ever want to relive anything like that again so um now now i had a good
[8150.26s -> 8158.83s]  experience at this year's coca dona so good that like thoughts have crept into my head about
[8159.87s -> 8164.67s]  my involvement in future years and again i don't i don't want to speak i don't want to say
[8164.67s -> 8169.31s]  anything i don't want to commit to anything i don't want to because i don't know but it's like
[8171.57s -> 8177.49s]  i i just don't know i don't know what the future holds and i think that it i think that last
[8177.49s -> 8183.73s]  year and like leading up to this race it was my goal to say like enough is enough like
[8184.85s -> 8190.37s]  i you know i don't need to keep killing myself and just being a good example for my daughter
[8190.37s -> 8195.97s]  like i don't i don't i don't necessarily want to do things that are like detrimental to my
[8195.97s -> 8201.01s]  health anymore and i think i think running and training for ultra marathons is like the best
[8201.01s -> 8207.97s]  thing that any human being can ever do for themselves the actual act of running 250 miles
[8207.97s -> 8212.53s]  is like not good for you like i don't know like how your health is or like how like what
[8212.53s -> 8219.25s]  you've had to deal with over the last 10 weeks but like um or like i actually think
[8219.25s -> 8226.53s]  100 milers in a way are worse like running 100 miles in a single effort push at the fastest you
[8226.53s -> 8231.97s]  can go for 100 miles is like pretty detrimental at least to me it's like detrimental to my
[8231.97s -> 8240.13s]  health um maybe not like physically but just like the whole like like i want to have good
[8240.13s -> 8245.25s]  energy you know what i mean like i i'm an old dad i'm 38 and had my first kid but like
[8245.97s -> 8251.41s]  i want to be 48 and still skateboarding with my daughter you know what i mean and it's like
[8251.41s -> 8257.81s]  that's more important to me than running 250 miles at this point so so that's sort of my
[8257.81s -> 8261.65s]  that's the only reason why i've said i don't want to run coca-dona anymore
[8262.45s -> 8267.65s]  but worst case scenario is like i will absolutely be there supporting other runners and being
[8267.73s -> 8275.81s]  trying to make people stoked for it and um and yeah and again it is part of why i agreed to do
[8275.81s -> 8283.65s]  the film is because like you know try and see the race off in the right direction and
[8285.25s -> 8288.05s]  actually going way back to what you said earlier about how
[8289.73s -> 8296.05s]  um you were asking me about how you feel like the film
[8296.69s -> 8303.89s]  um because of the contrasts that that that is shown in that film the value clashes too
[8303.89s -> 8309.57s]  the cultural clashes yeah yeah and and it was actually uh before before dylan ever came to
[8309.57s -> 8316.53s]  my house for this film we had probably like a two hour long phone conversation on the phone
[8316.53s -> 8322.85s]  and just about all the things and how i was feeling about being a part of another film
[8322.85s -> 8327.17s]  and how i feel like i've gotten enough attention at coca-dona like let's highlight some other
[8327.17s -> 8332.13s]  runners and blah blah blah and like i think one of the biggest things that he pointed out was
[8332.13s -> 8337.73s]  like after i had agreed to do the film and um he's like look i can come make i can come
[8337.73s -> 8344.53s]  make a film about you and about saddles and about whatever you know like and you know your
[8344.53s -> 8349.09s]  message gets delivered and like all of that's great but and maybe this is a conversation you
[8349.09s -> 8356.53s]  also had with him at some point but it was like he just pointed out to me he's like your story
[8356.53s -> 8362.69s]  and your message lands so much harder when it's when that when that contrast is shown
[8363.81s -> 8368.37s]  and i think it is a goal of mine to show that like you can have success
[8368.37s -> 8372.93s]  i get that i'm an enigma and like like the fact that i have a running sponsor and like
[8373.73s -> 8379.17s]  like not a lot of guys like me have support or sponsors i don't think i'm an enigma in
[8379.17s -> 8383.09s]  the sense of you if you looked at all trail runners in general but as far as like sponsored
[8383.09s -> 8387.57s]  athletes go i think i'm kind of an enigma and i get that i'm like really lucky but i do
[8389.01s -> 8394.05s]  embrace the opportunity to show people that like you can be successful in trail running
[8394.05s -> 8398.69s]  and you can get a lot out of trail running both like professionally and like personally and
[8398.69s -> 8406.37s]  emotionally and you don't have to subscribe to like the influencer the social media the
[8406.37s -> 8411.57s]  professional athlete the hyper competitive the hyper professional at like you don't have to
[8411.57s -> 8416.77s]  subscribe to any of that like you can be yourself and you can be genuine and you can be authentic
[8416.77s -> 8422.05s]  and and you're probably likely to have more success if you do that and not even saying
[8422.05s -> 8426.29s]  that has to look like me it doesn't have to look like me at all it could look like
[8427.25s -> 8432.93s]  the stereotypical solomon athlete like but but if that's your like genuine self and if that's
[8432.93s -> 8438.93s]  like who you are then fucking do that like the best that you can and it's like arlen like like
[8438.93s -> 8444.29s]  like i i love i like talking about arlen because i think he's also an enigma again for very
[8444.29s -> 8448.37s]  different reasons but like he was like you know he's like talked about like getting having
[8448.37s -> 8452.85s]  to like get social media accounts and like or like having to do all this other stuff or like
[8453.57s -> 8461.17s]  and be potentially become the stereotypical professional ultra runner and it's like arlen
[8461.17s -> 8466.45s]  like don't do that like be yourself like lean into being yourself because that's going to
[8466.45s -> 8472.21s]  be the best for you like and i think that he he can do that and i and i hope that he
[8472.21s -> 8476.93s]  continues to do i think he has done that and he's like he's not compromising who he is
[8477.81s -> 8484.77s]  as a person or the values that he has for any brand or for any and like that's what i admire
[8484.77s -> 8488.93s]  i'm not saying that everyone needs to like grow their hair long and get tattoos i just want
[8488.93s -> 8495.09s]  everyone to be genuine and to like fucking be who they are and if if you're that you like
[8495.09s -> 8500.29s]  you could have some success you know and that's what i want to represent to people is like
[8500.29s -> 8505.09s]  you can be successful just by being yourself and leaning into that and leaning into the things
[8505.81s -> 8511.09s]  that you find important so so all of that to say like like when dylan brought that up about
[8511.09s -> 8516.85s]  that message landing home a lot more clearly when it's put in contrast with some of these other
[8516.85s -> 8522.93s]  athletes again i'm not i don't want that to come off sounding wrong but i do think the
[8522.93s -> 8528.45s]  contrast showed and that's also true for their messages right like for whatever message they
[8528.45s -> 8533.33s]  have going into the film or for the for whatever motives they have for being involved
[8533.33s -> 8537.49s]  in the movie i think their message also gets delivered a lot better when it's shown
[8537.49s -> 8544.45s]  that again to steal kind of your point and what you were trying to say but yeah and for people
[8544.45s -> 8549.09s]  in the audience that need more context so this is dylan harris who's a great filmmaker in our
[8549.09s -> 8554.21s]  sport and i don't know if we can how much we can talk about it but the way i've interpreted
[8554.21s -> 8558.21s]  the direction of the film it's sort of like uh if people watched unbreakable about western
[8558.29s -> 8564.13s]  states 10 15 years ago like you had the four characters jeff rose hal kerner um you know
[8564.13s -> 8570.85s]  etc etc and like it's kind of reintroducing that type of uh storytelling style to the
[8570.85s -> 8575.33s]  2024 coconut 250 hopefully it comes out at some point later this year but i think it's
[8575.33s -> 8580.29s]  going to be great yeah no i i think i think it will be a really good movie i mean i trust
[8580.85s -> 8589.41s]  to make a really good film and um i think that yeah like i think like dylan was talking about
[8589.41s -> 8593.49s]  the movie unbreakable and how he's he's watched it like four or five times leading up to this
[8593.49s -> 8598.85s]  film mostly because he's trying to not just make unbreakable for coca donna you know
[8599.81s -> 8604.77s]  no no i mean i no i mean i think the premise clearly is that that premise of like
[8605.49s -> 8610.85s]  here are these different runners and here are here's a bit of their backstory here's some
[8610.85s -> 8617.57s]  of their home life you know here's the race um but so so you are you are 100 percent correct
[8617.57s -> 8622.21s]  in the sense that like that is sort of the premise of the film but um i think he's also
[8622.21s -> 8629.17s]  trying to have it be an original creative movie you know he's not just trying to make
[8629.89s -> 8634.37s]  that movie for coca donna you know it's like he's trying to and i think that he's
[8634.37s -> 8639.73s]  going to succeed in that i think that the time we've spent together filming um has been
[8639.73s -> 8645.17s]  very successful i even did some things that i probably like just agreeing to be a part of
[8645.17s -> 8651.57s]  the film once i agreed to be a part of the film and uh again i sort of went in with this
[8651.57s -> 8656.93s]  agenda right like i have all these like agendas and like but i also just once i decided to be
[8656.93s -> 8661.57s]  a part of it i just decided to you know not only am i going to be a part of it i'm going to make
[8661.57s -> 8665.81s]  i'm going to try and make it be the best film possible so there's a lot of things that i did
[8665.81s -> 8671.57s]  for dylan or or things that he got glimpses into or footage that he captured of us out at
[8671.57s -> 8678.69s]  granite mountain that i wouldn't have done for anybody else um or i wouldn't have felt
[8678.69s -> 8684.53s]  comfortable doing on film for anybody else so it's like i i think that at least on my end
[8684.53s -> 8689.97s]  um i can't speak for the other guys if they were that open with him but i think on my end i you
[8689.97s -> 8696.69s]  know i tried to make it the best that i could possibly make it so i think i think i hope and
[8696.69s -> 8701.25s]  i trust dylan to make a good story out of it i mean he's got his fucking hands full i can
[8701.25s -> 8705.57s]  tell you that uh especially with what happened at the race this year because like harry was
[8705.57s -> 8710.85s]  not one of the original member like cast members of of the film and it's like jeff
[8710.85s -> 8718.77s]  garmeyer they yeah well jeff yeah i i mean jeff um yeah i don't think anyone thought jeff was
[8718.77s -> 8723.41s]  going to do what he did and clearly no one thought harry was going to win yeah so um
[8725.25s -> 8731.65s]  which the originals were like is not valid arlen it was browning u arlen and mcnight right
[8731.65s -> 8736.69s]  those were the four kind of original subjects no i think arlen got added and i think it was
[8737.17s -> 8744.69s]  it was string bean it was originally joe myself jeff and mcnight and mcnight um
[8745.89s -> 8750.85s]  oh yeah so i think you know he's got he's got a hell dylan's got a hell of a task on his hands
[8750.85s -> 8756.53s]  just with the amount i was actually talking to him about like does it doesn't make more sense
[8756.53s -> 8761.57s]  is like a mini series at this point because you got six guys that you're documenting their
[8761.57s -> 8767.09s]  lives you have the whole race you have pre-race you have post-race is like what does the format
[8767.09s -> 8773.57s]  really make sense um you know i don't know it's not not none of my business but i trust dylan
[8773.57s -> 8777.17s]  is going to be able to figure it out and tell a good story and make a good film
[8777.17s -> 8784.61s]  so i've got three topics that i told myself i had to ask you about and uh one is alaska
[8784.61s -> 8789.17s]  mountain wilderness one is ultra marathon de caballo blanco and then i also have john
[8789.17s -> 8795.33s]  wesley powell written down here for some reason i want to start with uh the uh caballo blanco race
[8795.33s -> 8802.21s]  because i was reading your trip report from 2015 before reading this my ideal of it or my kind of
[8802.77s -> 8808.05s]  mental model of it was that born to run book right i had no idea that like it was enabled
[8808.05s -> 8814.05s]  by the cartels and that things got pretty rough down there yeah like people don't know
[8814.05s -> 8818.61s]  can you like fill them in on like what that experience was like yeah so i've i've been to
[8818.61s -> 8828.53s]  that race twice um in my life and the first year i went um was really awesome i i didn't
[8828.53s -> 8834.29s]  know anything i'd never run born to run still have never written read the book uh probably
[8834.29s -> 8842.21s]  don't tell anybody that but uh so it's fine like uh uh i didn't know anything about any of
[8842.21s -> 8847.49s]  that stuff all i like living in arizona and like sort of in border country my whole life and
[8848.53s -> 8852.53s]  it's like here and just like being a person who traveled my whole life and like i've traveled
[8852.53s -> 8858.05s]  through copper canyons and and mexico a bunch of times and and then you know 12 years ago i
[8858.05s -> 8862.61s]  start getting into ultra running and it's like oh like i hear this race that there's a race
[8862.61s -> 8865.97s]  that you can run with the tarahumara i was like well that sounds fucking awesome let's go
[8866.69s -> 8875.33s]  and so like went down and um it was it was at that race that i discovered there was this whole
[8875.33s -> 8883.81s]  other part of that race and that whole other part was the born to run stuff
[8884.93s -> 8892.85s]  and the and the mica true and the caballo blanco and that whole scene like and i was
[8892.93s -> 8902.21s]  certainly taken in by that community pretty quickly um but i i never felt totally comfortable
[8902.21s -> 8908.61s]  with that community it always it um and the reason why the reason why i'm saying that is
[8908.61s -> 8915.57s]  because i think i need to i need to sort of clarify my actions the following year and
[8916.21s -> 8921.01s]  the so the first year the race went really well it was like super fun ricky gates and
[8921.01s -> 8926.69s]  i were like the two first gringos of that race or whatever like that's actually where ricky and
[8926.69s -> 8933.57s]  i met and like ricky and i have become friends and it's like um for kind of probably obvious
[8933.57s -> 8942.30s]  reasons uh but like yeah just a great experience like super cool so much so that i like wanted
[8942.30s -> 8946.30s]  to come back the next year and like again a lot of the like race organizing people like
[8946.30s -> 8950.38s]  the caballo blanco born to run people like invited me back and it's like you know like
[8950.38s -> 8956.70s]  yes i'd love i'd love to come back and um and then that second year a really long story short
[8956.70s -> 8962.86s]  was ended up being a lot of cartel violence on the actual course like i think like
[8964.14s -> 8967.42s]  one or maybe two i don't i don't actually remember maybe you remember better because
[8967.42s -> 8971.66s]  you've read it more recently than i have but like there there were some deaths and some
[8971.66s -> 8978.38s]  kidnappings and there was some bombs that went off like on course and uh like a few days
[8978.38s -> 8983.90s]  leading up to the race and just a lot of stuff went down that weekend that sort of burst a lot of
[8984.62s -> 8993.34s]  americans bubbles and perceptions about what that race was and where it was and the sort of
[8995.78s -> 9002.67s]  um you know there's there's the reality of the race weekend you know and a bunch of
[9003.71s -> 9008.99s]  white americans invading upon this small community at the bottom of copper canyon
[9008.99s -> 9012.27s]  and the sort of safety net that's provided from that and then there's the other
[9013.79s -> 9020.11s]  51 weeks out of the year where you know it's cartel country and it's you know like you
[9020.11s -> 9028.99s]  run through poppy fields on the course you know and um i think that when all that stuff
[9028.99s -> 9036.11s]  went down the the race organizers and and i don't i do not disagree with this decision
[9036.11s -> 9042.19s]  at all that i think that was one thing that i i should say publicly is i do not disagree
[9042.83s -> 9048.11s]  with canceling the race like if a fucking bomb went off and somebody died on the saddles course
[9048.11s -> 9052.03s]  the day before the race it's like we're not having the race like i'm sorry like you know
[9052.03s -> 9057.39s]  what i mean it's like or if like runners are potentially in danger on the course like okay
[9057.39s -> 9063.23s]  like like so again i don't i don't disagree with having it like a commercially sanctioned
[9063.23s -> 9069.15s]  event like after something like that happens the thing i disagreed with was was the race
[9069.15s -> 9074.03s]  organizers and all of the tourists basically decided to say like we're not going to run
[9074.03s -> 9080.51s]  as like this this stand of a piece like they essentially said as long as there's violence in
[9080.51s -> 9087.15s]  the canyons we're not going to run and they took like a big stand and so like which
[9087.15s -> 9095.55s]  basically meant for most of those people they all left everybody left and so the local said well if
[9095.55s -> 9100.35s]  you're not going to have the race we're going to do the race without you like like we're going
[9100.35s -> 9105.95s]  to continue to have the race like you guys do whatever you want and and i think because again
[9105.95s -> 9110.43s]  because i was invited to copper canyon by the born to run people and the race organizers i
[9110.43s -> 9115.95s]  felt a certain amount of like i'll do whatever you guys say and then morning of the race
[9115.95s -> 9120.91s]  rolled around and like all like all the local nexicans and all the local tarahumara and like
[9120.91s -> 9124.27s]  all the locals were running the only people that weren't running were the white people
[9125.31s -> 9130.27s]  and i was like sitting there watching i was like this is fucking bullshit and so i just like i
[9130.27s -> 9134.75s]  had my shorts on underneath my pants and like my shoe like and i just like ripped my pants
[9134.75s -> 9139.07s]  off and like i just like ran up to the start this is like maybe like 20 minutes after they
[9139.07s -> 9143.39s]  started and i like ran up to the start line i was like draw a number on me and like the
[9143.39s -> 9147.55s]  locals like drew a number on me and like all the locals were like clapping and cheering
[9147.55s -> 9153.15s]  and i like took off and like started running and it's like and i think if i was anybody else
[9153.15s -> 9156.91s]  this is going to sound a little egotistical but it's like i need to say it to get the
[9156.91s -> 9161.55s]  point across i think if i was anybody else nobody would have cared but because i was
[9161.55s -> 9166.51s]  like the white people's like racehorse like everyone like wanted me to win the race that
[9166.51s -> 9171.95s]  year you know what i mean as far as like the non-locals go like and like Miguel Lara
[9171.95s -> 9176.83s]  and like all these other like fast local runners like knew who i was and was like you know so but
[9176.83s -> 9181.07s]  but the fact that it was because it was me that chose to run i think everyone took that as like
[9181.07s -> 9187.79s]  i was taking this like big dramatic stance either against or for somebody and it just wasn't
[9187.79s -> 9192.91s]  really the case it was it was literally just watching all the people like all the locals
[9192.91s -> 9197.79s]  starting to run and i was and i remember in my head thinking was like well not running
[9197.79s -> 9204.59s]  doesn't ever seem like the right answer like i'm just going to go run and i actually saw Maria who
[9204.59s -> 9209.63s]  was like Caballo Blanco's partner Micah's partner and she was a big part of the race
[9209.63s -> 9214.91s]  organization i actually saw her like 100 yards after i started running and i just like stopped
[9214.91s -> 9219.39s]  and i grabbed her and like gave her a hug and i was like i was like i respect your decision
[9219.39s -> 9224.67s]  but just know that this is my decision to like choose to run and she like gave me a big
[9224.67s -> 9231.63s]  hug and like kissed me on the cheek and like was like you know but but i do so all of that was
[9231.63s -> 9237.47s]  all of that was fine i do think the mistake was that i the way that i wrote that article
[9237.47s -> 9242.35s]  and it got picked up by runners world i think it definitely came off as like calling some people
[9242.35s -> 9252.83s]  out which maybe i did because like the the way you have to understand the way that that's
[9252.83s -> 9259.31s]  interpreted by like local people down there when like oh we have we live here 50 we live here 365
[9259.31s -> 9264.67s]  days a year and when the cartel decides to kidnap somebody or to kill one of our family members
[9265.31s -> 9271.79s]  we can't just leave like we fucking live here and the fact that that happened and at the
[9271.79s -> 9276.91s]  first like sign of a pin dropping all the white people like put on their patagonia and north
[9276.91s -> 9281.87s]  face shit and fucking booked it out of town and took the first flights like out of town
[9281.87s -> 9287.31s]  back to like san clemeni or santa barbara or whatever like that's not a great look it's just
[9287.31s -> 9291.95s]  not you know what i mean and i do think the race has recovered from that year at this point
[9291.95s -> 9297.31s]  like i think it's like a successful i haven't been in a long time but it's like i do think
[9297.31s -> 9302.27s]  me publicly sort of like what i just said to you i sort of said publicly in that article
[9302.27s -> 9308.43s]  and i think i definitely like it took it took a while for some of those like relationships
[9308.51s -> 9315.55s]  and friendships to come back because i do think that i yeah maybe should should have done that
[9315.55s -> 9324.27s]  no more like like no matter how politely you say no matter how politely you say publicly to
[9324.27s -> 9328.11s]  somebody that you did something wrong there's no there's no great way of saying that
[9329.95s -> 9334.99s]  and i i don't think everyone choosing to leave town and not run with the locals who
[9335.07s -> 9340.43s]  were there to run the race i think that was a wrong decision and i'm glad that i was able
[9340.43s -> 9344.67s]  to recognize that while i still had the opportunity to jump in and run the race
[9344.67s -> 9349.87s]  versus recognizing that from a from like the plane of the windows i'm flying out of town
[9349.87s -> 9353.95s]  you know what i mean like i was able to recognize that 20 minutes after the start
[9353.95s -> 9360.90s]  while i still had an opportunity to jump in and run the race so like i feel lucky that
[9360.98s -> 9367.54s]  happened were you running scared in the sense that like there could be bombs exploding around
[9367.54s -> 9373.70s]  you and there could be violence at any point on the course now never because i don't none of i
[9373.70s -> 9378.82s]  think if that threat was real none of the locals would have run i think i think that you
[9378.82s -> 9387.14s]  embrace i think as a traveler like you embrace the advice and the mindset of the locals not
[9387.22s -> 9395.06s]  of the other tourists and that that was really big for me like it like if the locals were like okay
[9395.06s -> 9398.90s]  we're not going to run either it's too dangerous i wouldn't have run but the only people that
[9398.90s -> 9402.90s]  didn't run were the people from california and from or from wherever you know it's like
[9403.62s -> 9406.98s]  all the americans and all the international runners those are the only people that didn't
[9406.98s -> 9414.74s]  run that year and so yeah it makes me think about a lot of travel advisories not just
[9414.74s -> 9420.98s]  for third world countries but for even countries like the us where like how much do you abide like
[9420.98s -> 9426.26s]  theoretically you could have an advisory permanently on the us saying that if you decide
[9426.26s -> 9431.46s]  to travel here a mass shooting could happen right because we have a ton of mass shootings
[9431.46s -> 9436.10s]  in this country like that's like one of our things we have to reckon with so and we live
[9436.10s -> 9439.38s]  in it right like we live under the threat of that every single day regardless of whether
[9439.38s -> 9443.86s]  you're in new york or california or texas whatever like it's just it's something that we
[9443.86s -> 9448.74s]  live under i also i also think just like when you when you spend your time traveling a lot
[9448.74s -> 9454.02s]  like you sort of realize that like all travel advisories are pretty fucking silly in the
[9454.02s -> 9458.18s]  sense that like you just need to be a smart person like in the same way that like i'm not
[9458.18s -> 9464.50s]  going to walk through a subway through like new york city or like i'm not going to walk
[9464.50s -> 9468.58s]  down like i'm not going to spend my time like running down back alleys in new york city at
[9468.58s -> 9475.70s]  three in the morning because like maybe like maybe don't do that you know so it's like it's
[9475.70s -> 9480.02s]  like you just use that same sort of thing anywhere that you are it's like don't put
[9480.02s -> 9484.66s]  yourself in dangerous situations and you're probably fine and i didn't i didn't feel like
[9484.66s -> 9490.82s]  at any point i put myself in a dangerous situation actually the most dangerous part
[9490.82s -> 9494.74s]  of that entire weekend was the night before the race before the race was
[9495.62s -> 9502.34s]  um the race had announced there was like there were everyone was in like the square of the
[9502.34s -> 9509.62s]  town yeah and like the race had announced that they were canceling the race like publicly
[9510.18s -> 9514.58s]  and like a bunch of locals were like there and there was like a lot of drinking going on
[9514.58s -> 9519.86s]  and like like locals were like grabbing the mic and like saying
[9521.70s -> 9528.18s]  just like some like it was it just wasn't a great vibe it was like super like something's
[9528.18s -> 9532.42s]  like about to happen here and it's not gonna revolts can happen it's like not going to be
[9532.42s -> 9537.46s]  great because there's a lot of econ i mean i mean that that weekend is and has become
[9537.46s -> 9542.26s]  like the biggest weekend for that entire community community that's not drug related
[9543.14s -> 9547.86s]  and so to cancel the race is not it's not like it's this small decision that has zero
[9547.86s -> 9552.02s]  consequences like not having the race has very real consequences on that community
[9552.90s -> 9558.66s]  and that was the only time that i ever felt like oh shit like this feels like you know that
[9558.66s -> 9563.46s]  you know that feeling you get like in a public situation or if there's like a fight
[9563.46s -> 9566.82s]  fight that happens or something like it kind of felt like that where it was like
[9567.86s -> 9571.46s]  that was the only time i remember ever feeling weird the morning of the race felt
[9573.22s -> 9577.94s]  awesome it actually was like i mean again i'm gonna fucking
[9579.94s -> 9587.79s]  like fucking i'll just say it felt i mean it felt like the most authentic way i possibly
[9587.79s -> 9591.55s]  could have experienced that race like i was the only fucking white person to get to run
[9591.55s -> 9598.35s]  you know what i mean and it was like uh so yeah it was i mean for me it was all great
[9598.35s -> 9602.35s]  experiences the one regret i have is like ruffling feathers with the article but i felt
[9602.35s -> 9609.31s]  like i needed to sort of explain myself a little bit like publicly because i think if i hadn't
[9610.35s -> 9616.99s]  i think my decision to run would have been contrived as worse than me explaining myself
[9620.11s -> 9624.03s]  yeah again so it's like i don't write a whole lot of things but when i do it seems to have
[9625.95s -> 9629.39s]  well linked to it in the show notes it was good i really i thoroughly enjoyed it and i'm
[9629.39s -> 9635.47s]  glad we had a chance to touch on it here um gotta ask you about the alaska mountain
[9635.47s -> 9639.39s]  wilderness classic too so like how you were introduced what made it interesting
[9639.39s -> 9643.55s]  and you know what was meaningful about it in retrospect so i feel like this is not on many
[9643.55s -> 9647.71s]  people's radars so i'd love to hear you kind of respond that it's funny i i brought up
[9647.71s -> 9656.42s]  the colorado trail experience earlier um the colorado trail experience was very negative
[9658.62s -> 9664.86s]  for a lot of reasons but the alaska the alaskan experience was really negative because i like i
[9664.86s -> 9674.86s]  almost fucking died like and i was out of my element and i was not prepared for it i'm not
[9674.86s -> 9679.82s]  good at water sports i'm not comfortable on big alaskan whitewater and pack rafts
[9681.34s -> 9686.46s]  at mile 200 when i haven't slept again because i can't sleep during these things
[9687.66s -> 9694.30s]  i made a lot of really dumb mistakes on the water i went swimming which you do not fucking do
[9696.46s -> 9703.50s]  um i went swimming a couple times and it's fucking dangerous dude and it's like and that's
[9703.50s -> 9708.46s]  just for me because like i'm not a i'm not a water sports guy like i'm used to southwestern
[9708.46s -> 9713.74s]  water where you like you come up to a rapid you get out you look at it you like figure
[9713.74s -> 9717.98s]  out the best way of going through everyone gets nervous and then one person does it and you
[9717.98s -> 9722.70s]  realize it's not that big of a deal and everyone does it and laughs and then you like sit there
[9722.70s -> 9726.62s]  and float again for two hours and then you like come up to the next rapid and like repeat
[9726.62s -> 9733.02s]  you know what i mean like like water sports to me are like leisurely and pack rafting in
[9733.02s -> 9744.30s]  alaska is not leisurely it's like and so uh anyways uh i've spent quite i've spent a fair
[9744.30s -> 9750.22s]  bit of time in alaska i have i have a friend nick trinen who lives up there and nick went to
[9750.22s -> 9756.38s]  prescott college so i met him from prescott and nick and lex and like like that whole family
[9756.38s -> 9761.50s]  up in alaska are big skiers they're all like cross country same with all the trail running
[9761.50s -> 9764.38s]  scene up there i don't know if you've ever experienced the trail running scene up in
[9764.38s -> 9769.50s]  alaska but it's like especially the summer races it's like it's all of the it's all of the
[9769.50s -> 9775.18s]  cross-country like skate like olympic skate team that goes to apu they'll like jump into
[9775.18s -> 9779.58s]  these trail runs that's why the all the trail races up there are so competitive and so
[9779.58s -> 9784.14s]  hyper competitive because you have all these like olympic athletes like olympic skiers
[9784.78s -> 9791.02s]  running these races uh anyways that's just an interesting little side note but um nick and i
[9791.02s -> 9796.62s]  become friends and he has a he has a big property along with my other friend glenn that has a big
[9796.62s -> 9805.02s]  property up on lazy mountain outside of palmer alaska um and nick nick did the race the year
[9805.02s -> 9813.34s]  before we did it together as a solo and he won the race and i was supposed to do that year
[9813.34s -> 9819.50s]  with him but i got covid that year so i didn't go um and i i did the colorado trail instead
[9820.06s -> 9825.50s]  uh that year but then when the next year rolled around nick wanted to do it again but he didn't
[9825.50s -> 9829.50s]  want to do it solo because he thought it was too dangerous so he said like i was one of the
[9829.50s -> 9837.26s]  only people that he could see doing that with i think because he respected my ability and he
[9837.26s -> 9841.42s]  respected a lot of things about me in the outdoor world that he felt comfortable doing
[9841.50s -> 9845.82s]  that with me um and i feel like i failed nick
[9849.10s -> 9857.84s]  why because i was dangerous because i i wasn't capable of doing that race safely
[9857.84s -> 9863.92s]  and and i bit off like more than i could chew and i think nick is one of the most
[9863.92s -> 9870.24s]  accomplished alaskan like outdoor athletes that i've ever met and i think anyone who
[9870.24s -> 9876.48s]  knows like alaskan outdoor sports whether it be like skiing or running or like
[9877.92s -> 9884.08s]  they know they know the trinans and you know like they know that family and uh but nick
[9884.08s -> 9888.24s]  is like overly humble he's like the classic little brother he like doesn't think anything
[9888.24s -> 9894.72s]  he does is that impressive or like that so he thinks everyone can just kind of do that stuff
[9894.72s -> 9904.24s]  and um i think it's actually a case where having too much humility in certain situations
[9904.80s -> 9909.60s]  isn't good i think it's a really healthy thing that you like acknowledge and i've even had to
[9909.60s -> 9914.08s]  do this like for myself like with trail running and other mountain sports where it's like
[9915.04s -> 9920.32s]  holding everyone to the same standard as you because you're overly humble isn't really fair
[9920.32s -> 9926.08s]  to everyone around you can be dangerous can be very dangerous and i think nick overestimated
[9926.08s -> 9936.32s]  my ability on like alaskan waters i think i did too and i think that like and we made a
[9936.32s -> 9943.44s]  we made a massive mistake at the beginning of the race that there's a big decision every
[9943.44s -> 9949.36s]  team at that race has to make and it's whether or not to bring dry seats and and we chose
[9949.36s -> 9957.84s]  to not bring dry suits because we decided that the sections that we had to run and pack rafts
[9957.84s -> 9968.80s]  weren't that bad um and so i was hypothermic for the entire time i was out there and
[9969.36s -> 9973.20s]  just trying to get through it and it was just another complete like suffer fest and
[9973.20s -> 9980.08s]  i was embarrassed about about my experience um with nick i feel like
[9981.20s -> 9988.40s]  because when you do that sort of thing as partners you know i put him in a lot of danger
[9988.40s -> 9995.12s]  as well by by making stupid mistakes basically relaxing there were there were a lot of times
[9995.12s -> 10001.68s]  where we would get to a big river and i would let my guard down and i would relax because
[10001.68s -> 10008.80s]  i thought we were good and like like the last were five miles from the finish
[10010.16s -> 10017.28s]  so for anyone that doesn't know the alaskan mountain wilderness is or the the uh god i can't
[10017.28s -> 10021.84s]  even think the the wilderness classic is they move the race every three years they've been
[10021.84s -> 10026.24s]  doing it for a few decades now and every three years the route gets moved but it's
[10026.24s -> 10033.60s]  always around a 200 mile completely wilderness trek through different parts of alaska that involves
[10033.60s -> 10040.08s]  they also have a winter one which is a lot of ski like obviously skiing um which actually it's
[10040.88s -> 10044.96s]  it i know it sounds crazy but the winter one is actually a lot more enjoyable and easier than
[10044.96s -> 10049.92s]  the summer one because the winter one you can just ski over everything summertime in alaska is
[10049.92s -> 10055.36s]  like very wet very buggy very boggy very difficult terrain to move through versus the
[10055.36s -> 10060.48s]  winter ones you can just ski over everything so not to not to downplay the winter one the winter
[10060.48s -> 10068.40s]  one's still like pretty gnarly too but yeah um but um i've got the wikipedia pulled up for
[10068.40s -> 10072.16s]  it now like it's pretty cool to see just like the how the route has evolved over the years
[10072.16s -> 10077.52s]  and um yeah i see like i mean you and nick i mean you guys won the race we did win the
[10077.52s -> 10081.36s]  race yeah so that's something that like people like when i talk about it they're like well you
[10081.36s -> 10089.44s]  won the race and i was like well yeah again like race is a big like big quotation marks around
[10089.44s -> 10095.04s]  race you know what i mean but it's like uh like everyone's a paraglider in this thing in some
[10095.04s -> 10100.00s]  years you can do anything it's like it's like it's it's a point a to point b route and
[10100.00s -> 10108.24s]  however you think you can get there the fastest um is is game so if yeah if you
[10108.24s -> 10112.00s]  want to haul a paraglider to the top of the mountain and jump off of it like you're welcome
[10112.00s -> 10119.60s]  to do that but you have to haul that paraglider for the next 200 miles as well um so yeah it's
[10119.60s -> 10124.32s]  just a guy who there was a guy who was 81 i'm sorry he was 81 years old and he finished in
[10124.32s -> 10129.52s]  2008 yeah it's fucking crazy dude the the whole race so like i think everyone in alaska
[10129.52s -> 10134.00s]  like at least in the outdoor community like everyone in alaska knows about the wilderness
[10134.00s -> 10139.44s]  classic like if you can bring it up in conversation but like like i think the year i did it there were
[10139.44s -> 10145.60s]  like 15 people who started it like everyone knows about it and everyone like talks about
[10145.60s -> 10149.68s]  it and if you win it like you're like i i definitely have like a lot of fucking cred with
[10149.68s -> 10156.00s]  people up there for like doing that race with nick but like nobody wants to do it like like
[10156.00s -> 10160.96s]  no one's interested in actually doing it because it's a fucking it's a it's brutal man
[10160.96s -> 10167.04s]  it's like it's gnarly it's and it's not gnarly in the sense of like barkley like if you get lost
[10167.04s -> 10172.00s]  you just like find your way back it's like like if you drop you have to get you have
[10172.00s -> 10176.88s]  to call in an airplane it's the only way to get out and the year we ran it with the year
[10176.88s -> 10181.52s]  we did it was so wet that no airplane could land because there was so much moisture still
[10181.52s -> 10186.72s]  on the ground any of the air pads that they had up in the mountains the only way to get out
[10187.12s -> 10194.00s]  is to hire a helicopter so if you drop from the race you have to you have to charter a helicopter
[10194.00s -> 10200.72s]  from uh to like come and get you there's there's no way out it's like there's just no fucking
[10200.72s -> 10204.72s]  way out so it's like it's a potentially dangerous that's why i've had a lot of
[10204.72s -> 10210.64s]  friends in the lower 48 ask me about it and like ask me how they sign up and how they do
[10210.64s -> 10217.92s]  it and i was like look i'll tell you like with the like sort of or i'll like i'll add i'll like
[10217.92s -> 10224.56s]  get you on the email list with the sort of agreement that like like understand i don't
[10224.56s -> 10229.92s]  want you to do this like it's not a safe thing at least for me and and i i mean i
[10229.92s -> 10234.64s]  think a lot of the people who do it like do it safer but but nick and i again were trying
[10234.64s -> 10239.44s]  to race it we were trying to do it as fast as we could we brought less gear which made
[10239.44s -> 10246.80s]  it more dangerous and i made i made some really stupid decisions out there which ended up like
[10246.80s -> 10251.52s]  putting myself and nick in danger and i still feel bad about it like to be totally honest
[10253.36s -> 10256.96s]  did the fact that this might be the fracture this might be the first time i've ever publicly
[10256.96s -> 10261.60s]  like talked about it too i don't like i don't really like talking about it it wasn't
[10261.60s -> 10266.56s]  like i had like i had like nerve damage on my feet for like two or three months after that
[10266.56s -> 10273.44s]  like it was like i'd be back in prescott in the middle of summertime and it'd be like 95 degrees
[10273.44s -> 10277.36s]  out and i'm pouring sweat and i'd be driving around my like old shitty four-runner with
[10277.36s -> 10283.52s]  the heater on full blast on my feet because my feet were like freezing cold for like two weeks
[10283.52s -> 10288.08s]  after the race and i had like pretty bad nerve damage on like the bottom of my feet like it
[10288.08s -> 10291.92s]  took a few months for like the feeling to come back on the bottom of my feet and it was like
[10292.24s -> 10298.08s]  like it was like fucked up dude yeah so you think this race makes
[10298.80s -> 10307.44s]  barkley look tame in some ways in in the like in the danger to the athlete
[10307.44s -> 10313.76s]  absolutely um in the i don't think it's any i don't think it's harder than barkley i think
[10313.76s -> 10319.20s]  i think barkley's this uniquely thing where he's like found something that's like right on that
[10319.20s -> 10330.08s]  line of like um like like people finish the wilderness classic every year you know and it's
[10330.08s -> 10335.52s]  like okay it's not it's actually not that great like you can do it safely and you can do it
[10335.52s -> 10339.92s]  appropriately again and this is going back to the coca-dona conversation it's going back to
[10339.92s -> 10344.72s]  the arizona trail conversation it's like if you just don't race it and you do it like in
[10344.72s -> 10348.80s]  a more appropriate manner you can have like really awesome experiences and you can do all
[10348.80s -> 10354.80s]  that if you're trying to race and do it as fast as you can you make certain safety decisions
[10354.80s -> 10361.76s]  trade-offs trade-offs and and like like i think i there there was a part of me
[10362.40s -> 10371.04s]  that wanted to go back and do it again with nick and to do it correctly um
[10372.56s -> 10378.32s]  because i think there's a thing that i have where like like i remember out of granite
[10378.32s -> 10382.00s]  mountain granite mountain is the big like multi-pitch climbing area outside of prescott
[10382.00s -> 10387.52s]  where i've like obviously climbed a lot and it's like we i had to i had to watch this
[10388.08s -> 10393.04s]  this prescott college student one day like take a huge fall and had to like lower him down
[10393.04s -> 10397.28s]  off the mountain like be me my friend josh and i who were climbing together had to be the guys
[10397.28s -> 10401.36s]  to like lower him off the mountain get him back to the trailhead and luckily he ended up
[10401.36s -> 10406.80s]  being okay but it was like the next day josh and i went out and climbed the route that he
[10406.80s -> 10412.16s]  was on i think just for ourselves like psychologically moving forward knowing that like
[10412.80s -> 10417.60s]  it was him it wasn't the rock it wasn't the mountain it was him as a climber that made it
[10417.60s -> 10422.96s]  dangerous so i think it's good to like sort of move past these traumatic things that happen
[10422.96s -> 10428.80s]  in outdoor sports and realize that the traumatic things that happen can be mitigated
[10428.80s -> 10434.16s]  can be controlled so there was a part of me that wanted to go back and do it in a safe
[10434.16s -> 10440.24s]  way with nick which i feel like having the experience of the first year and just being a
[10440.24s -> 10447.28s]  quote unquote veteran of the race i could have done it a lot better more efficiently faster
[10447.28s -> 10451.92s]  and more safely i think i could have done all of those things um but now that i have a
[10451.92s -> 10457.60s]  daughter like i'm just not i'm not ever going to go out on a pack raft in alaskan white
[10457.60s -> 10463.28s]  water again like i'd rather free solo shit up a granite mountain which like you know
[10463.28s -> 10469.60s]  like i'd rather do that than if the alaskan mountain wilderness classic moved to a route
[10469.60s -> 10473.04s]  that didn't have to be pack rafted which i don't think it ever will because that's like an
[10473.04s -> 10479.68s]  integral part of that race uh maybe but i just i don't trust myself on big alaskan water
[10479.68s -> 10485.04s]  anymore it's like unless i took the time to like get good at water sports but i've always
[10485.04s -> 10489.20s]  been afraid of water that's one reason i've never floated the entire grand canyon like
[10489.20s -> 10494.24s]  i floated a bunch of segments of it in my pack raft but like i don't like big water i'm scared of
[10494.24s -> 10503.20s]  it so yeah damn one of the things that strikes me about you is like you have so much physical
[10503.20s -> 10508.32s]  and mental courage but you're also pretty forthright about instances where you've been
[10508.32s -> 10514.80s]  intimidated or scared or even just like reflective of um like mistakes and i really i mean i i
[10514.80s -> 10519.52s]  really respect that and kind of want to honor that here because um thanks i think it's one thing
[10519.52s -> 10524.56s]  to like be it to like really demonstrate that like you're a badass and like you know you can do
[10524.56s -> 10531.20s]  tough shit but like to have that like sensitive side i guess is just is admirable too like i
[10531.20s -> 10534.96s]  i just want to say like i i honor that and i appreciate that a lot and uh that means a
[10534.96s -> 10542.16s]  lot i appreciate it so yeah um yeah i mean i try and i try and be honest about stuff and
[10542.96s -> 10548.56s]  like again like like acknowledging like it shouldn't be taboo to say this like acknowledging
[10549.12s -> 10553.04s]  your own ability with things like i am pretty fucking good at some things and that's fine but
[10553.04s -> 10557.20s]  like that's fine to acknowledge you know what i mean like i don't think everyone can run you
[10557.20s -> 10561.04s]  said it's actually dangerous not to acknowledge it's dangerous not to acknowledge it and it
[10561.04s -> 10567.44s]  puts other people around you in bad situations to assume everyone can do everything that you can
[10567.44s -> 10574.32s]  do and it's like it it when when you think that about yourself when you think you're
[10574.32s -> 10582.80s]  not better than anyone at anything else it creates bad dynamics because you get really
[10582.80s -> 10590.24s]  frustrated with those people and the and and the other people in turn feel embarrassed they
[10590.24s -> 10598.00s]  feel insulted it just creates bad dynamics like it's really important for safety in the mountains
[10598.00s -> 10603.20s]  for everyone to set their egos aside and acknowledge their skill set know what you're
[10603.20s -> 10609.76s]  good at know what you're bad at like i'm bad at rivers fucking sports like period you know
[10609.76s -> 10615.68s]  what i mean like there's a lot of things that i'm actually pretty bad at like but i also need
[10615.68s -> 10619.76s]  to acknowledge what i'm really good at because then i'm not i don't have that expectation of
[10619.76s -> 10624.88s]  other people and i know i have to like tone it down and like help those people through
[10624.88s -> 10632.00s]  that stuff so it's it's like it's it's one of those things where like social sort of niceties
[10632.00s -> 10636.24s]  or the way that we're taught to behave socially it doesn't actually work very well
[10637.44s -> 10646.24s]  um so you have to yeah last last topic question i promise um how would the american
[10646.24s -> 10653.04s]  southwest look different if we had listened to john wesley powell yeah actually i uh i made a
[10653.04s -> 10659.04s]  bumper sticker one time that said it had a big picture of of it had a big picture of him and
[10659.04s -> 10664.96s]  it just said not my lake on it um because of lake powell you know and it's like he would have
[10664.96s -> 10670.16s]  fucking hated lake powell with a passion everything that he preached and everything that he
[10670.64s -> 10676.32s]  uh talked about with like water conservation well it's also important when talking about guys like
[10676.32s -> 10681.12s]  this like like powell or like like even like rusevelt or something these like sort of early
[10681.12s -> 10686.64s]  figures in the conservation movement is that the word conservation back then didn't mean
[10687.12s -> 10692.56s]  wilderness conservation and then it meant conservation of resources so when like theodore
[10692.56s -> 10696.56s]  rusevelt is talking about like how national forests need to be conserved he's talking
[10697.52s -> 10703.12s]  about the resource of wood needs to be like conserved and taken care of so that we can
[10703.12s -> 10708.56s]  exploit that and that and then that goes into a big thing that people don't understand about
[10708.56s -> 10714.16s]  the blm and the national forest is like unless it's a wilderness unless it's set aside as a
[10714.16s -> 10724.48s]  wilderness wilderness conservation is not their goal like like mineral or like i just i can't
[10724.56s -> 10730.08s]  say it any better than a conservation of resources so that sort of like just clarifies how things
[10730.08s -> 10734.80s]  operate when like we're talking about public lands in this country is to understand that the
[10734.80s -> 10739.68s]  national forest service is not a conservation society or a wilderness society unless it's a
[10739.68s -> 10746.96s]  wilderness area um so john wesley powell was really instrumental in and water development
[10746.96s -> 10752.56s]  uh when he was alive he was a he was a director of something i don't really i can't
[10752.56s -> 10757.68s]  tell you the biography of the guy but he was in like the geological society and and doing a
[10757.68s -> 10765.04s]  lot of like water development stuff especially after his exploratory years he got really into
[10765.04s -> 10775.92s]  like the conservation of water resources and basically everything that the bureau of reclamation
[10775.92s -> 10784.08s]  has done in the 20th century has been in like direct conflict with his advice for water resources
[10786.72s -> 10794.00s]  so in short i mean that's that's a um yeah the world would be very different i mean
[10794.00s -> 10798.48s]  the entire western development of why we have towns where they do and why we have
[10799.20s -> 10803.36s]  roads where they are and why we have infrastructure where we have infrastructure
[10803.44s -> 10806.80s]  is because of two things it's because of the railroad and because of water
[10806.80s -> 10811.28s]  and water development projects over the 20th century completely shaped the landscape of
[10811.28s -> 10817.28s]  the american west and it's actually i would recommend everyone to like try and think of
[10817.28s -> 10821.76s]  a book like like a book like cadillac desert yeah so have you read cadillac desert so
[10821.76s -> 10825.92s]  cadillac desert is hard to get through it's sort of it's sort of an academic book a little
[10825.92s -> 10832.96s]  bit yeah but cadillac desert is one of the most eye-opening books for why the west
[10832.96s -> 10837.36s]  exists the way it does so if you want to know why the west like the entire like the 13 states
[10837.36s -> 10842.24s]  in the american west like everything west not not of the hundredth meridian but close to the
[10842.24s -> 10848.96s]  hundredth meridian uh like the 13 big big western states so it's like new mexico
[10850.08s -> 10858.32s]  colorado wyoming montana i think i drew that right those states and everything west of there
[10858.32s -> 10861.92s]  why everything exists the way that it does then like read cadillac desert i think it's
[10861.92s -> 10869.76s]  one of the most eye-opening books that there is uh yeah anyways uh and basically that entire
[10869.76s -> 10877.04s]  book is outlining the united states's approach to water conservation which john wesley powell
[10877.04s -> 10882.00s]  would have just thrown up in his mouth about how we do it and now and there's reasons i
[10882.00s -> 10886.80s]  mean now i mean we look at the state of arizona you look at the southwest and you look at the
[10886.88s -> 10894.64s]  flooding of some of the greatest like wilderness areas that has ever existed and uh the catastrophes
[10894.64s -> 10899.28s]  that we're dealing with now john wesley powell was a really big advocate of like this is
[10899.28s -> 10904.88s]  fucking turning into a history lesson uh he was a really big advocate of like small like small
[10904.88s -> 10910.48s]  water storage places and lots of them versus these like massive reservoirs that we have like
[10910.48s -> 10914.80s]  lake powell and like meeting the southwest which is like just not great for long-term
[10914.80s -> 10922.64s]  sustainability a whole host of other reasons but but the guy's fucking awesome too just as
[10922.64s -> 10929.76s]  a historical figure like how many like white civil war era historical figures do we have
[10929.76s -> 10934.08s]  that was like advocating for like aboriginal rights and would like there's always like
[10934.08s -> 10939.04s]  pictures of him like painted up and dressed up and like hanging out with aborigin like
[10939.04s -> 10943.44s]  that's maybe the term i shouldn't use i don't but it's like uh he was just an
[10943.44s -> 10948.00s]  awesome fucking dude and there's not a lot of like historical figures that were awesome dudes
[10948.00s -> 10953.84s]  you know most of them are like slave owners so right yeah he's like of all of the like of
[10953.84s -> 10960.16s]  all the people in this country that are like held up on pedestals you know how he's not
[10960.16s -> 10968.46s]  one of them he's a fucking american hero i i really want to double thumbs up cadillac
[10968.46s -> 10972.94s]  desert one of the because i live in salt lake city and it's a huge pending issue
[10972.94s -> 10978.22s]  the drying up of the great salt lake and what would happen could the wasatch front even exist
[10978.22s -> 10982.94s]  as a population center if that thing dries up one of the big scary stories that we always think
[10982.94s -> 10987.58s]  about is from cadillac desert where lake owens dries up and you have to evacuate that whole
[10987.58s -> 10992.54s]  community right because all of those whatever it's like the metals that exist on the bottom of
[10992.54s -> 10997.82s]  that lake when they're exposed and they catch wind it's toxic right like salt i mean salt
[10998.38s -> 11004.62s]  in california is yeah so los angeles was pretty predatory like in order for los angeles to grow
[11004.62s -> 11010.86s]  they had to take on pretty predatory like water resource tactics it's see what it became today
[11010.86s -> 11015.02s]  fucking insane the stuff they did and the and the things they're still doing
[11015.74s -> 11021.82s]  it's really really crazy it's so crazy i mean i mean yeah i mean famously the movie
[11021.82s -> 11028.54s]  chinatown or whatever is about it uh but it's just yeah it's all it's all super interesting
[11028.54s -> 11033.66s]  and like i said i i just being like a a citizen in the western united states and just
[11033.66s -> 11038.38s]  understanding why things are the way that they are i mean water development and the bureau of
[11038.38s -> 11045.18s]  reclamation the interior department it's like yeah water development and railroads it's crazy
[11046.78s -> 11049.98s]  i think everyone's going to take something different from this conversation for me
[11049.98s -> 11053.90s]  what's stuck with me throughout is i need to reintroduce more boredom into my life that's
[11053.90s -> 11058.14s]  something that's my next course of action i really think that's a for me that was an important
[11058.14s -> 11063.10s]  takeaway um because i think i was on my generation which is maybe slightly after you was on that
[11063.10s -> 11067.34s]  fringe of like there was boredom but like we also kind of had access to like the razor
[11067.34s -> 11071.26s]  phones and stuff so yeah i want more of that in my life what's been good for me is
[11071.26s -> 11075.98s]  again i mean i know i'm a broken record here but like having a daughter and just like
[11076.94s -> 11081.98s]  like we're not even going to watch like movies with her until she's three years old you know
[11081.98s -> 11086.22s]  what i mean it's like that first few years of like childhood development we just feel like
[11086.22s -> 11093.50s]  is so important like no screens no televisions no phones no anything and it's like having her
[11093.50s -> 11098.38s]  as an excuse to like remove all of that stuff has like really helped me and like i'm playing
[11098.38s -> 11102.86s]  more guitar and i'm skateboarding more and i'm you know built a climbing wall and built a mini
[11102.86s -> 11107.18s]  ramp and have the band room and playing music with people and recording music again for the
[11107.18s -> 11115.02s]  first time in like a decade you know and it's because you don't realize how much of an effect
[11115.02s -> 11119.82s]  it has on you when you're constantly being you're constantly getting those
[11121.50s -> 11125.58s]  whatever buttons pushed in your brain and you're constantly getting those satisfied by
[11126.14s -> 11132.38s]  like fucking reels you know it's like or whatever it's like
[11133.98s -> 11137.98s]  like it's like one of those things that's like drinking you know like i don't drink anymore like
[11137.98s -> 11142.86s]  i haven't drank in a few years and it's like you don't realize how much people drink until
[11142.86s -> 11149.18s]  you stop drinking like you don't you don't realize how like everyone's social engagement
[11149.18s -> 11154.22s]  and lifestyle revolves around having a drink until you stop doing it and then you're like
[11154.22s -> 11160.22s]  oh shit like we fucking drink a lot like like you but you don't you don't realize it and it's
[11160.22s -> 11163.66s]  the same thing with your phone it's the same thing i mean i don't mean to like talk shit about
[11163.66s -> 11168.78s]  like youtube because like too i'm on a podcast it's going to be on youtube right now it's like
[11168.78s -> 11172.06s]  where you know we can all be a part of it and we can all exist in it but it's like
[11173.98s -> 11182.06s]  making conscious decisions like it's not something again it's like we we talk a lot about the
[11182.06s -> 11186.14s]  same way that like runner like all these like professional athlete runners talk about balance
[11186.14s -> 11189.74s]  and like they're some of the most like unbalanced people of you like you couldn't
[11189.74s -> 11193.74s]  contain your laugh when i said that's not safe for them to say talk about safety that's not
[11193.74s -> 11197.02s]  safe for them to say so like that i mean that's a big thing in ultra running right you hear
[11197.02s -> 11201.26s]  all these guys say like oh i'm just like balance in my preference falsification and it's
[11201.26s -> 11204.30s]  like you're the most some of the most unbalanced people i've ever met in my life
[11204.30s -> 11208.54s]  and it's like and then it's the same thing with like cell phones like we all talk about
[11208.54s -> 11211.98s]  how like we need to have like responsible relationships with like cell phones and
[11211.98s -> 11216.54s]  like or like with our kids like we need to like limit screen time it's like why are you limiting
[11216.54s -> 11221.90s]  screen time like you're not you need to limit screen time like you know what i mean it's like
[11222.54s -> 11228.46s]  like why do we think that like our kids generation is going to be better at it when
[11229.02s -> 11233.98s]  we're not even capable of having a healthy relationship with it like i still think my wife
[11233.98s -> 11239.82s]  and i look at our phones way too much you know what i mean and it's like like there's something
[11239.82s -> 11245.90s]  about it that like even though i want to be better so bad i'm like i'm not able to like
[11247.02s -> 11252.30s]  i still like if i'm like taking a shit i still open instagram you know what i mean it's like
[11253.42s -> 11258.62s]  we used to have a joke about that how like anyways i'm sure that's like a popular joke
[11259.18s -> 11268.30s]  but it's like uh like yeah it's like it takes very conscious decisions and deliberate actions
[11268.30s -> 11275.90s]  on your part to like remove that aspect of your life and i think for a lot of people that's like
[11275.90s -> 11279.26s]  television you know what i mean so it's like you don't realize how much television you
[11279.26s -> 11282.70s]  watch until you stop watching television it's like holy shit i used to watch a lot of
[11282.70s -> 11287.50s]  television for your cell phones like holy shit i used to always be on my phone didn't even
[11287.50s -> 11293.98s]  realize it you know what i mean and and what's been really big for me is like if my daughter
[11293.98s -> 11299.74s]  like crawls into the room and i have my phone in my hand it's like it's not good enough to
[11299.74s -> 11305.10s]  just put the phone down because she already saw it she already walked into the room she
[11305.10s -> 11310.70s]  already saw me looking at this fucking thing and she's already prioritizing that thing that
[11310.70s -> 11315.90s]  i'm clearly prioritizing so like it's not just good enough to put your phone down and
[11315.90s -> 11321.02s]  to not engage with it it has to be more than that it has to be like like i actually get a
[11321.02s -> 11328.86s]  lot of shit from my friends and family about how bad i am with my phone it's because this
[11328.86s -> 11336.62s]  idea that we have to respond to everyone immediately like it'll take me at least like
[11337.50s -> 11342.22s]  if you if you text or call me during the day like i will not respond until at least that
[11342.30s -> 11347.98s]  evening if you're lucky like it could go into like the next night or something like that
[11347.98s -> 11354.70s]  it's because i've consciously had to say like i'm not going to look at my phone from like morning
[11354.70s -> 11361.58s]  until evening and so like like like this idea that we have to respond to every text message
[11361.58s -> 11366.46s]  with within a few minutes or we have to like someone calls us and it's like why didn't you
[11366.46s -> 11369.98s]  call me back and it's like well i did call you back but on my own fucking terms like
[11369.98s -> 11374.94s]  i'm not addicted to my phone like everybody else so like well i mean i kind of am that's why i've
[11374.94s -> 11380.70s]  had to go through extreme measures to to not do it but it's like just putting things down is
[11380.70s -> 11389.34s]  not good enough it's like separating yourself from that is is really important because i'm
[11389.34s -> 11395.98s]  because clearly i've demonstrated to myself i'm not capable of having a healthy relationship
[11396.06s -> 11401.66s]  with it if my phone's always on me i've i've demonstrated that if it's on me every time
[11401.66s -> 11406.46s]  someone texts me i open it up and i look and then i accidentally click on instagram
[11406.46s -> 11410.78s]  and then i accidentally click on facebook marketplace because i need a fucking trampling
[11410.78s -> 11416.30s]  or whatever you know it's like it's like like i'm not capable of having a healthy relationship
[11416.30s -> 11422.70s]  with it so put it away completely separate it and then you'll be bored and then you'll fill
[11422.70s -> 11429.02s]  that time with writing or telling stories or podcast you know like like creating things
[11430.06s -> 11437.66s]  like be an active member of of yourself first of all and of of human beings
[11438.86s -> 11444.62s]  like don't be a passive observer of just i mean it's fine to observe things fine like i
[11444.62s -> 11449.26s]  you know people are watching me say this so it's like like you can observe things but
[11449.26s -> 11454.78s]  you also need to engage with the world around you and and in today's world it takes conscious
[11454.78s -> 11462.62s]  deliberate actions to engage with the world around you and to be an active member of again
[11462.62s -> 11467.74s]  yourself and of the human race and society so it's like it takes takes fucking effort
[11467.74s -> 11474.14s]  today it's not easy anymore so i know we didn't do a formal intro but i do want to
[11474.14s -> 11478.38s]  do a formal outro and i'll just say i deeply appreciate this conversation i know this was we
[11478.38s -> 11483.26s]  went relatively long in the scheme of things i don't think i've done a three hour podcast
[11483.26s -> 11488.30s]  before so it means a lot um and i'm i'm stoked to have gotten to know you better and really
[11488.30s -> 11493.26s]  appreciate your perspective so thank you so much yeah i mean right right back at you
[11493.26s -> 11497.66s]  you know what i mean when you emailed me about doing it um i know we've like danced around
[11497.66s -> 11505.10s]  it for a while now but just i mean i wish i actually wish we could talk more about your
[11505.10s -> 11511.34s]  experience maybe we still can but if you can ask me whatever you want uh i mean how was
[11511.34s -> 11517.90s]  how was your experience i first off like quick quick what's your reaction to when somebody asks
[11517.90s -> 11526.38s]  you that i want to that was perfect that sigh i want to i want to couch it in a way that
[11526.38s -> 11533.74s]  makes it as accessible as possible because i i i want yeah are you glad are you glad that you
[11533.74s -> 11540.46s]  did it of course are you going to do it again i can't it's if the race has gotten too popular
[11540.46s -> 11547.50s]  i i can't pony up 1500 bucks this quickly off of off of a race like what if i went to oh yeah
[11547.50s -> 11552.30s]  100 you do it yeah yeah i would do it again yeah i'm on the cocoa donut crack pipe for sure but
[11552.30s -> 11557.18s]  like um yeah like it's already sold out and there's 400 people on the way list or something
[11557.18s -> 11560.78s]  crazy like that and it's a week after the race it's blown up i did not i did not know
[11560.78s -> 11565.82s]  that holy shit yeah it's already sold out and there's already i mean it's may 22nd
[11566.46s -> 11573.34s]  and the last time i checked there was about 275 people on the wait list so it's it's it's hit
[11573.34s -> 11581.26s]  escape velocity that's that's amazing i didn't know that yeah but yeah i mean i i love that
[11581.26s -> 11588.14s]  race and um i think the big takeaway for me was that it's actually pretty it's pretty easy
[11588.14s -> 11593.50s]  to do something that's relatively hard if you're like spiritually invested in it and
[11594.14s -> 11598.94s]  the this was yeah i've never experienced alignment for a race just on like a
[11600.38s -> 11604.86s]  existential level or whatever as i have with coca donna like just i think and i think a
[11604.86s -> 11610.30s]  lot of that you i chalk up to again the heart and soul piece of this and jamil and i'm sure
[11610.30s -> 11615.90s]  you were involved in it to some extent like architecting a route that had a ton of meaning
[11615.90s -> 11619.50s]  like from start to finish like there wasn't i was never any point in the race like
[11620.22s -> 11627.02s]  looking forward to flagstaff because i got to see crown king and arastra and whiskey roe and
[11627.02s -> 11631.74s]  gerome like geez gerome is a trip yeah holy shit like that it was an end in and of itself
[11632.54s -> 11638.22s]  so um nothing was wasted like i was engaged the whole time and i can't say that about most
[11638.22s -> 11643.50s]  races so yeah i mean just based off my own experience this year i never once even
[11643.50s -> 11649.90s]  thought about dropping yeah like it never even like and i think to anyone who's even run 100
[11649.90s -> 11654.62s]  miler like you think about dropping a fucking lot all the time all the time and it's like i
[11654.62s -> 11660.22s]  had just committed this year i just knew i was gonna finish and it was never even and never
[11660.22s -> 11666.78s]  even entered my head that dropping was like a thing and i don't know how i actually it was
[11666.78s -> 11671.90s]  something i realized after the race i was like that's incredible i never even thought
[11671.90s -> 11679.58s]  about it um yes which i think is amazing how many yeah how many had you ever done in multi-day
[11679.58s -> 11685.10s]  before through hike through hike of the appalachian trail back in 2014 so like the
[11685.10s -> 11689.90s]  the mentality of not getting over fixated on a finish and being comfortable with like going
[11689.90s -> 11693.42s]  through the night and stuff that was not foreign to me so that helped a ton you did it but i
[11693.42s -> 11699.26s]  never uh yeah i had to get back to like a job so i did it in like three months which is
[11699.26s -> 11704.38s]  kind of compressed but not like yeah not like the month and a half you see like a scott jurich or
[11704.38s -> 11708.54s]  you know what he did on the easy t like he was he was like fast but not fast that makes sense
[11710.06s -> 11715.58s]  yeah so um but yeah the big thing for me was just it's going to be extremely hard for me to
[11715.58s -> 11722.22s]  ever sign up for another race without a very like rigorous examination of like what's gone into
[11722.22s -> 11725.10s]  the race like you talked about saddles like most of almost everything you're saying about
[11725.10s -> 11730.62s]  saddles like that checks the boxes of why you would sign up for something um like i i largely
[11730.62s -> 11734.30s]  agree with like your approach to race directing and like why you would create something in the
[11734.30s -> 11740.70s]  first place so yeah well what was the matrix term like red pilled or blue pilled is it
[11740.70s -> 11745.02s]  right yeah i've been red pilled in terms of events yeah i mean well you'll always as a just
[11745.02s -> 11748.86s]  a tangent you'll always if you want to run saddles you're always welcome for free i'll
[11748.86s -> 11755.58s]  give you a spot um i mean that's like that's actually maybe i shouldn't say this on like a
[11755.58s -> 11761.10s]  public forum but it's like if anyone ever asked me for a free spot i'd be like yeah sure like
[11762.46s -> 11767.58s]  it's like i don't really care but but i mean like people make a big people make a big
[11767.58s -> 11772.86s]  like people so people want me to run a 50k or open a 50k like i like i get messages all
[11772.86s -> 11778.86s]  the time for people wanting to run a 50k yeah and it's like well just come run a 50k
[11780.78s -> 11783.74s]  like you don't you don't have to run the whole 50 and it's like well
[11784.62s -> 11787.98s]  it's like and then they're like and then their next response would be like well it'd
[11787.98s -> 11791.34s]  be cheaper if it was a 50k isn't it and it was like well it's on public lands
[11793.82s -> 11799.18s]  like just come run whatever you want like i don't i don't care like like this i like
[11799.18s -> 11806.46s]  the idea that like every like or like i have some other like like sponsored runner friends
[11806.46s -> 11811.98s]  like sort of around arizona and i think because it's like it's on ultra sign up and they don't
[11811.98s -> 11817.10s]  want like things to show up it's like just come run like don't sign up like just come do
[11817.10s -> 11823.02s]  whatever you want this idea that we have to do anything at these races is like it's like
[11823.02s -> 11826.62s]  i sort of want to move away from that if you want to run a 30k with some aid stations
[11826.62s -> 11831.90s]  in between choose whatever 30 miles of the saddles course that you love the most and come run that
[11831.90s -> 11836.30s]  30 miles and if you want to contribute to the community then sign up if you don't want to
[11836.30s -> 11839.82s]  contribute then just come run it and that's totally fine too you'll still be a part of
[11839.82s -> 11845.26s]  the community it's like do whatever the fuck you want at these races and so it's like i mean
[11845.26s -> 11850.62s]  i think that i mean i think like a lot of times we want run races to challenge ourselves
[11850.70s -> 11856.94s]  and do what we set out to do right but if that if that's not the case for you if you still want
[11856.94s -> 11862.30s]  to be a part of the race and still want to be a part of the community like please do so or like
[11862.30s -> 11866.06s]  all these other rules surrounding races like i would get i would get a lot of emails last
[11866.06s -> 11871.10s]  year about like can we use poles it's like i don't fucking care if you use poles or not
[11871.10s -> 11877.10s]  it's like or like can we have dogs like i don't care like like or like the last the last two
[11877.10s -> 11882.70s]  miles runs from the trailhead like down into town and like through town and i would get i
[11882.70s -> 11888.70s]  would get emails from people about like can my crew like pay can my crew all pace me that like
[11888.70s -> 11893.74s]  last two miles or am i going to get disqualified it's like you can literally do whatever the
[11893.74s -> 11898.94s]  fuck you want to do like like this idea around races where like it's so like regimented and
[11898.94s -> 11903.26s]  rules and like you can't like do anything or like like i got shit the first year at
[11903.26s -> 11908.06s]  coca-dona because people outside of flagstaff were like meeting me on the trail and like wanting
[11908.06s -> 11911.74s]  to drink a beer with me and it's like so i would stop and drink a beer with them people are like
[11911.74s -> 11917.58s]  oh he's receiving aid from outside or whatever and it's like like if somebody runs into you
[11917.58s -> 11923.10s]  at saddles and wants to give you something and engage with you like i might disqualify you
[11923.10s -> 11927.82s]  for not because you're being an asshole like like be like be a part of the community
[11927.82s -> 11934.54s]  engage with everyone that wants to engage with you if you're like like all outside crew is allowed
[11935.26s -> 11940.54s]  your crew can access you at any point during saddles wherever you want and can give you
[11940.54s -> 11947.66s]  whatever the fuck you want like i do not care like i just don't care about any of that shit
[11947.66s -> 11953.02s]  so it's like with with saddles like yeah do whatever you want like and i understand that
[11953.02s -> 11957.66s]  that can't exist for a lot of like hyper competitive things but like saddles isn't
[11957.66s -> 11962.38s]  ever going to be that so it's like saddles and again i don't know what saddles is going to be
[11963.42s -> 11968.14s]  but i'm just not going to limit it by saying all this like stuff about what you can and
[11968.14s -> 11975.10s]  can't do like a lot of us a lot of us run these right that's why i i had a i i had a
[11975.10s -> 11980.14s]  big problem with the gear requirements this year at coca-dona i was not happy about it
[11980.94s -> 11985.34s]  and i don't think it's appropriate for race directors to be telling runners how to run
[11985.34s -> 11989.74s]  their race and are like what they need to run their race and there are some of us that can
[11989.74s -> 11997.26s]  run that section very easily on two liters of water yeah and well not saying that everyone
[11997.26s -> 12003.74s]  should do like obviously no like most people shouldn't do that but a race mandating what you
[12003.90s -> 12009.34s]  have to carry even if it's in their best interest i just i i just don't like it
[12010.22s -> 12013.90s]  it's not it's it's not something it's actually a big reason why i don't like running
[12013.90s -> 12018.38s]  in europe i don't like running races in europe because i don't want to carry all that shit
[12018.38s -> 12024.86s]  i do i hate carrying shit it like for a guy that does it like i never wear a vest
[12024.86s -> 12032.14s]  i don't like stuff on my body and like body body kinesthetics are are sensitive you put
[12032.14s -> 12041.58s]  five six seven pounds on my back i run completely differently right and and that affects my race
[12042.78s -> 12048.30s]  and so like i i don't like i don't want to carry all that shit around mont blanc yeah i
[12048.30s -> 12053.74s]  don't want to carry snow pants in 85 degree weather it's like um when you're running
[12053.74s -> 12058.06s]  through a village every 10 miles it's like these are not like crazy wilderness and i'm
[12058.06s -> 12063.58s]  going on a whole gear mandatory tangent no i appreciate it but it's like uh yeah it's like
[12063.58s -> 12069.10s]  i don't remember why i started talking about saddles but um it's like i wanted to say
[12069.10s -> 12073.42s]  something about that and like i totally vibe with you and and i agree that like
[12073.98s -> 12080.70s]  if people want the freedom to jump in at mile 20 of saddles and do the final 50k that's great
[12081.50s -> 12085.74s]  and that's actually something like that sort of laissez-faire approach to racing like
[12085.74s -> 12093.02s]  i identify with that i think that if it's not 99 it's probably 90 of runners like they're super
[12093.02s -> 12099.42s]  like rituals and traditions and formalities are super important to them i think most humans want
[12099.42s -> 12103.50s]  predictability and i think in our community most people want something to show for what they
[12103.50s -> 12108.70s]  just did yeah so i think they need that like even if it's like even if you just have to
[12108.70s -> 12113.90s]  kind of roll your eyes and create the 50k like they want that you know yeah um with
[12113.90s -> 12120.46s]  coca donna like i honestly if if if there if there was going to be no proof that i did coca
[12120.46s -> 12125.98s]  donna i would still do it because i love that course so much like yeah i i i needed nothing to
[12125.98s -> 12132.22s]  show for like that was totally for me but um i think most of us need like the validation
[12132.22s -> 12136.70s]  so it's it's it's important to have it there i think it's good to reflect on why you need
[12136.70s -> 12141.18s]  that stuff though you know oh yeah it's like i've done stuff for validation all the time
[12141.18s -> 12145.26s]  like i'm not immune to that i do it probably once or multiple times a day it's like i alluded to
[12145.26s -> 12151.58s]  the belt buckle thing earlier is like why do you guys all want belt buckles like like i
[12151.58s -> 12156.46s]  think i have like i've done a lot of races where i have belt buckles i think i've already
[12156.46s -> 12160.54s]  lost my coca donna belt buckle you know what i mean it's like that's like not great for
[12160.54s -> 12167.98s]  me to say that but it's like it's it's like why like um and i think that's another example
[12167.98s -> 12176.54s]  of like satisfy or uh saddles can exist sort of on this extreme end of that spectrum where it's
[12176.54s -> 12184.30s]  like makes you hopefully makes you question why we're doing these things what are our motives
[12185.50s -> 12193.90s]  like um do i need like what if i what if i what if i created a social media ban
[12194.30s -> 12199.98s]  on on saddles what if i made everyone sign a waiver at the beginning that said you're not
[12199.98s -> 12207.02s]  allowed to talk about your run on social media i think that's funny i mean that's a cool idea
[12207.02s -> 12210.94s]  actually i mean i just had that idea for the first time like but just like what if
[12211.66s -> 12217.23s]  like how many people would do it how many do you think would do you think you would sell out
[12217.95s -> 12223.58s]  i don't i think the person that already the type of person that already runs saddles is
[12224.54s -> 12229.58s]  is sort of embracing the experience so i think that i've already kind of routed the right person
[12229.58s -> 12235.02s]  i would be curious though how many people that would check that box and how many people would
[12235.02s -> 12244.53s]  be able to fulfill that yeah you know like i get i get made fun of all the time about how
[12244.53s -> 12249.33s]  like i'm the only person in the world that's ever like finished a hundred miler and not
[12249.33s -> 12254.77s]  talked about it on social media even like coca donna i never said anything about it other
[12254.77s -> 12262.29s]  than satisfy creates posts and and they're like a collab or whatever so it's like and again i'm
[12262.29s -> 12266.21s]  not trying to sound like elitist or whatever it's just it's just interesting conversations
[12266.21s -> 12270.37s]  like why are we doing these things like why are we running 50 milers we all know we can run
[12270.37s -> 12276.13s]  i mean in our case for example like like or why are we running 50ks for the hundredth time
[12276.13s -> 12280.45s]  like you know you can run a 50k like is it to be a part of the race or is it to get a
[12280.53s -> 12286.45s]  t-shirt to get a glass to get a belt buckle to post about it on instagram to share to get attention
[12286.45s -> 12291.57s]  and again not even saying those are bad things like there's something about the human nature
[12291.57s -> 12297.01s]  and the human psyche that like attention feels good and instead of me tearing down people
[12297.65s -> 12301.49s]  why tear it down people drive around with like flags on their fucking diesel trucks
[12301.49s -> 12305.81s]  because they want attention like that should annoys me but like there's something about
[12305.89s -> 12311.57s]  attention that feels good from other human beings being validated and being
[12313.01s -> 12317.65s]  popular being like just receiving attention there's something about the human condition
[12317.65s -> 12321.97s]  where that feels good so instead of me tearing that down saying that's not like a
[12322.93s -> 12327.33s]  that's not a good thing i mean i don't think it's a good thing to become addicted to
[12327.33s -> 12333.17s]  or to like become obsessed with but it is clearly there is clearly something about the
[12333.17s -> 12339.41s]  human condition that like human beings lean into that so i think it's good to identify those
[12339.41s -> 12346.29s]  things and to have like a more i think it's good to identify those things and have an
[12346.29s -> 12350.05s]  appropriate relationship with those things instead of becoming addicted to those things
[12350.69s -> 12355.57s]  and and attention can come in any form it can come it can come into being asked to be on
[12355.57s -> 12360.69s]  a podcast it can come being asked to be a part of a documentary or being getting a lot
[12360.69s -> 12365.17s]  of attention on social media whether that however that looks on whatever you know what i mean like
[12365.81s -> 12371.73s]  or just being like a popular person in your community like when you go to a group run and
[12371.73s -> 12376.05s]  people want to take photos with you or whatever it's like there's a lot or people want to
[12376.05s -> 12380.45s]  introduce themselves to you because they they saw your podcast and they're big fans of you
[12380.45s -> 12387.57s]  or whatever you know it's like attention feels good right so like well i don't know
[12387.57s -> 12392.53s]  what i'm talking about again because i did what i've been doing all it's like uh like
[12393.57s -> 12399.17s]  yeah i i think i think the social experiment putting i think i might actually do this putting
[12399.17s -> 12405.81s]  a button on saddles saying you're not allowed to share stuff you're not allowed to share
[12405.81s -> 12414.05s]  your story just as an experiment what if what if you could only share it using technology
[12414.05s -> 12418.69s]  that existed before like the year 2000 or something that'd be cool like what if you had
[12418.69s -> 12422.53s]  to like you could like write letters to people or something about it or you could you could
[12422.53s -> 12425.81s]  you could make a film about it but it would have to be on something that used film
[12426.53s -> 12432.93s]  yeah like i don't know i i think this is a really good conversation to answer the question
[12432.93s -> 12437.17s]  earlier about like what i see saddles being is like i see saddles being just like this
[12437.17s -> 12442.85s]  opportunity to like try shit and just like see see what happens because i don't care about
[12442.85s -> 12446.85s]  i mean i care like i want people to sign up because i think it's a really good experience
[12446.85s -> 12451.33s]  like i think everyone who ran saddles last year like had a really great time except for me
[12451.33s -> 12455.49s]  but i was the race director so like like i think i'm the only one with anything negative
[12455.49s -> 12459.81s]  to say about the race last year and i think that's how it should be probably because that's
[12459.81s -> 12464.37s]  like my job title so i like i want people to run it to experience it and to like have a
[12464.37s -> 12468.13s]  good time and to like do all of those things but other than that i really don't care how
[12468.13s -> 12473.41s]  many people sign up like it already has enough people i think like i think like 80 or 90 people
[12473.41s -> 12478.53s]  are already signed up and that's almost how many people ran last year so like that's great i
[12478.53s -> 12483.33s]  don't really care like again other than wanting people to experience it but it's like
[12484.69s -> 12488.93s]  i just think it's this cool thing i think i think again to go back to other conversations
[12488.93s -> 12492.61s]  when you're not motivated by the money like you can try all these weird things
[12493.17s -> 12499.73s]  and you can be creative like you can you can you can just treat it like an art project
[12499.73s -> 12504.45s]  and just make it as weird as you fucking feel like making it and that's more exciting to me
[12504.45s -> 12510.05s]  than me making like 50 grand on it or whatever or like yeah i don't know i was like i was
[12510.05s -> 12515.09s]  looking at the arizona monster like sold out i was like holy shit it's like prince money
[12515.09s -> 12517.25s]  it's like nine hundred thousand dollars
[12520.21s -> 12526.13s]  holy shit like i mean i'm sure a lot of those entries are like not paid for but it's like
[12526.13s -> 12530.93s]  whatever you know it's like or like coca donna like what it's what is it now how much is it
[12532.69s -> 12536.93s]  i don't know you have to check but go look at that waitlist and ultra signup it's it's burly
[12538.45s -> 12542.93s]  yeah it's insane it's just like what i think but with saddles it's like yeah the numbers
[12542.93s -> 12548.45s]  we're dealing with at saddles are like clearly not that and like all the money just goes back
[12548.45s -> 12554.85s]  into the race so it's like it's it's um actually i mean i mean set i mean saddles
[12555.49s -> 12564.43s]  doesn't cost me any money but it costs satisfy a lot of fucking money okay like yeah
[12566.11s -> 12570.27s]  at saddles because you know the fain ranch aid station that satisfy runs are there
[12570.27s -> 12576.35s]  do they create aid stations at saddles in the same image because i love that aid station
[12576.35s -> 12582.83s]  so we did i had them do the start finish line so the start finish line was was satisfied out
[12583.71s -> 12588.99s]  that's awesome but the the aid stations weren't it was just a little bit too much
[12590.43s -> 12596.11s]  for the first year and just um and and a lot of that's on me to be totally honest like
[12596.11s -> 12601.39s]  breeze again the owner of satisfy he's constantly throwing out throwing these ideas that he wants
[12601.39s -> 12606.03s]  to do and i'm just like constantly shutting him down because it's just a lot of work and it's
[12606.03s -> 12610.03s]  like i don't really want to do like i don't like i'm actually kind of the wrong guy to
[12610.03s -> 12614.59s]  be in the race director role for that race because i'm like shutting things down a lot
[12614.59s -> 12619.79s]  of the time um but the matt that's gonna help me take over the races in utah he's
[12619.79s -> 12626.35s]  gonna come on at saddles as well and he's a lot better at the like at the bells and whistles
[12626.35s -> 12631.31s]  side of things and like the the community side of things like he's a community organizer and
[12631.31s -> 12635.63s]  like does like farmers markets and things so like the idea of like closing down a block
[12635.63s -> 12640.67s]  of the street and having like a bunch of activities for people like it doesn't scare him
[12640.67s -> 12647.63s]  where to me i'm like pretty intimidated by it so uh yeah we'll see i mean
[12650.11s -> 12654.19s]  i have a kid coming on september 28th allegedly that's the due date but if i
[12654.19s -> 12658.67s]  if i wasn't if i didn't have a kid on the way i would be there it sounds like a blast we'll
[12658.67s -> 12662.75s]  we'll throw a link in the show notes and um that's awesome dude i'm really happy for
[12662.75s -> 12667.55s]  you is he your first kid first kid and i mean i think for all the reasons you described
[12667.55s -> 12677.47s]  like i've led a pretty selfish existence to until now and that's yeah well but like even then even
[12677.47s -> 12681.87s]  just the thought of having a kid has made me reevaluate and it's gonna be good for me like
[12681.87s -> 12685.79s]  again selfishly it's gonna be good for me because i think it's gonna force me to realize
[12685.79s -> 12690.11s]  that i'm not the most important person in the world and someone else is and i think just a lot
[12690.75s -> 12694.51s]  more wholesome decision making and like contributions come from that and it sounds like
[12694.51s -> 12698.75s]  that's been the case for you so i'm pretty stoked yeah and like i don't know if you're like me or
[12698.75s -> 12707.78s]  not in the sense of like living i've sort of lived my whole life in this like constant flux
[12707.78s -> 12715.78s]  of like existential like crises of like not knowing like why i'm here why i want to be here
[12715.78s -> 12727.14s]  like what excites me to be alive and um like having a child out of all all all the
[12727.14s -> 12731.86s]  shit i've talked about experiencing life and being an active member of the human race
[12732.50s -> 12737.06s]  nothing is ever nothing i've ever done has ever come close to like the satisfaction and
[12737.06s -> 12744.66s]  fulfillment of like having this little girl that i am completely fucking obsessed with and
[12744.66s -> 12751.94s]  i'm about to start crying on your podcast but i'm gonna i'm gonna pull it back i feel that dude
[12752.02s -> 12757.06s]  i mean honestly i've never had i've never really had existential dread but i attribute this and
[12757.06s -> 12763.06s]  this is a little bit self-deprecating but it's true i don't think i i'm a i'm a like high high
[12763.06s -> 12769.14s]  iq person all the high iq people that i know have existential dread you included and like
[12769.14s -> 12773.46s]  i i'm not quite there in terms of processing powers i don't think too deeply about like
[12774.26s -> 12778.82s]  my my like role on the planet like i'm just if i'm like engaged in something and it's like
[12778.82s -> 12783.62s]  occupying me and i'm stoked on it and i feel like it could put a small dent in some little
[12783.62s -> 12789.62s]  subculture like i'm rolling that's awesome but uh i've never been like you know why am i here
[12789.62s -> 12795.86s]  type stuff but that's for like 150 people and i'm probably like 110 120 well i don't give
[12795.86s -> 12801.14s]  yourself credit but maybe you're just better at processing things than we are i don't know
[12801.14s -> 12806.10s]  but i don't know it's like dude i'm super happy for you that's that's awesome and um
[12806.10s -> 12816.10s]  um i don't know i'm just i feel really excited for you and um yeah i get really like so i'm 38
[12816.10s -> 12821.38s]  and out of all of my closest friends in this world i'm the first one to have kids
[12822.26s -> 12827.94s]  wow um kind of us too for my wife and i like the kind there's like one other uh
[12828.02s -> 12834.82s]  uh friend but like yeah i what's it what's been like and it's like it's it's hard because
[12835.70s -> 12840.10s]  like i look around this world and i see the people that do procreate and like the ones that
[12840.10s -> 12846.42s]  are having kids and it's like that kind of like you know not just for the kids but for
[12846.42s -> 12850.98s]  the parents too like they're they're like they're either too young or like they're not like
[12850.98s -> 12855.06s]  stable in their lives and like all the all these things like people that are having kids
[12855.06s -> 12862.34s]  like and just like yeah just there's a lot of reasons why and then i look at like some of my
[12862.34s -> 12868.34s]  closest friends and like not only would they make like the absolute best parents in the world
[12868.34s -> 12873.22s]  but they i think they're also the type of people like me that would stand to gain the
[12873.22s -> 12878.82s]  most from having a child um like i think i'm a much i i'm i am a much better person
[12880.99s -> 12888.11s]  than i was a year and a half ago or any other in any other point in my life i feel like i'm

[12918.43s -> 12923.23s]  have like she's gonna have the best fucking life ever and that's given me a new lease
[12923.23s -> 12928.43s]  on life and motivation to like give her that like like i don't have necessarily have the
[12928.43s -> 12933.15s]  motivation for myself to go out and like seize the fucking day you know and like make
[12933.15s -> 12940.11s]  the most out of my life but since it's for her she's gonna have the best life i can possibly
