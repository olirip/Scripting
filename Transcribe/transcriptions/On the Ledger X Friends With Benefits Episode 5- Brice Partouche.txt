[0.78s -> 10.38s]  All right, we're joined today by Brice Partouche, also here in Paris, of a brand called Satisfy
[10.38s -> 11.78s]  Running.
[11.78s -> 15.66s]  For those who don't know Brice or Satisfy, he's one of the first people I was lucky
[15.66s -> 20.00s]  to meet when I moved here to Paris almost eight years ago, which is about the time
[20.00s -> 23.86s]  that he started Satisfy, and we'll hear more about that.
[23.86s -> 28.76s]  Before that, he had a brand that was a clothing brand known for its jeans called
[28.76s -> 34.12s]  April 77, and he's done a lot of other things that we'll hear about.
[34.12s -> 40.68s]  And the conversation that I'm really excited for us to have today is one about branding.
[40.68s -> 47.04s]  What I realized having many conversations with founders in the Web3 space about, you
[47.04s -> 51.88s]  know, these new brands that they've started based on whether it's, you know, PFP
[51.88s -> 54.40s]  or art or, you know, etc.
[54.40s -> 59.88s]  And then having conversations with Brice about, you know, building a brand over the
[59.88s -> 64.76s]  last eight years in the fashion space was that, you know, these two, you know, worlds
[64.76s -> 71.84s]  needed to hear this conversation and maybe even have this conversation together.
[71.84s -> 77.76s]  Also Brice has done some, you know, pretty forward thinking things in Web3.
[78.36s -> 83.08s]  It's not his whole brand, but he's dabbled more than most fashion brands, I would say,
[83.08s -> 85.32s]  and earlier than most fashion brands.
[85.32s -> 87.28s]  So we'll get a chance to hear about some of that, too.
[87.28s -> 90.80s]  So Brice, thank you so much for coming on and sharing your experience with us.
[90.80s -> 92.08s]  Oh, thank you for having me.
[92.08s -> 94.24s]  I'm super happy to be here with you guys.
[94.24s -> 97.44s]  Well, so Zoe has a very important first question for you.
[97.44s -> 101.68s]  Yeah, the very important first question is what is the first concert you ever went
[101.68s -> 105.04s]  to and what is the most recent concert you've been to?
[105.08s -> 107.20s]  OK, that's easy.
[107.20s -> 115.20s]  First concert I've been to was, so in France, we had in the late 80s, this punk band
[115.20s -> 118.96s]  called La Mano Negra, La Mano Negra.
[118.96s -> 120.32s]  And it was like...
[120.32s -> 121.80s]  The Black Hand?
[121.80s -> 123.88s]  Yes, the Black Hand in Spanish.
[123.88s -> 128.92s]  And that was this band like, you know, in France, we are really good for, or really
[128.92s -> 134.40s]  good or really bad, but we try to imitate a lot of what's happening in the UK or
[134.40s -> 135.20s]  in the US.
[135.20s -> 138.56s]  So basically, La Mano Negra was a French clash.
[138.56s -> 144.20s]  And so they were mixing like, you know, dub and punk and reggae.
[144.20s -> 149.16s]  And yeah, it was my first show with my with my cousin.
[149.16s -> 152.68s]  I remember she had a beer and she was 15 and she was like, Oh, don't tell
[152.68s -> 155.28s]  my dad that I'm having a beer right now.
[155.28s -> 157.24s]  And I was 12.
[157.24s -> 162.28s]  I went back the day after to school with my new like Mano Negra T-shirt,
[162.32s -> 165.12s]  way too big for me.
[165.12s -> 165.60s]  It was great.
[165.60s -> 170.32s]  Like the first time I was seeing like a mosh pit and like people like diving
[170.32s -> 174.48s]  with like dog mountains, like, you know, like it was pretty, pretty hardcore.
[174.48s -> 180.72s]  But like the La Mano Negra was, you know, they were kind of not soft,
[180.72s -> 182.88s]  but like it was a fake punk band.
[182.88s -> 186.48s]  I think they wanted really to be punk, but like they also wanted to be
[186.48s -> 187.92s]  played on the radio.
[187.92s -> 193.12s]  And the last show I've been to was two days ago.
[193.12s -> 200.16s]  I saw with you, Ian, we saw Build to Spill, amazing band.
[200.16s -> 201.88s]  I know that's the way you're being fun.
[201.88s -> 204.60s]  It's my favorite, my favorite band.
[204.60s -> 206.56s]  It was the first time I was seeing them.
[206.56s -> 210.08s]  I was keeping on like missing them.
[210.08s -> 214.20s]  But I'm glad we finally, so it was amazing.
[214.20s -> 220.48s]  It's just like, I don't know, it's so like low key and pure.
[220.48s -> 221.44s]  It was great.
[221.44s -> 225.24s]  Did you get some like really good, long, prolonged guitar
[225.24s -> 227.60s]  noodling, like enough of that?
[227.60s -> 227.92s]  Yeah.
[227.92s -> 229.72s]  I mean, it's just like serene.
[229.72s -> 235.64s]  One review could be like Neil Young, but better in every way.
[235.64s -> 238.52s]  It was, I was, I was absolutely incredible.
[238.52s -> 241.64s]  And I sent Zoe all the videos and I sent Zoe Tommy's videos.
[242.64s -> 245.80s]  So yeah, I was going to say, I think I know what show you were out last,
[245.80s -> 248.64s]  unless you went to one last night, which is totally possible knowing you.
[248.68s -> 252.64s]  So Brice, like just for, for everyone, like let's, let's do a,
[252.88s -> 253.92s]  let's do a background.
[253.92s -> 255.72s]  Like, where do you, where do you come from?
[255.72s -> 256.56s]  Like, what do you do?
[256.56s -> 258.68s]  And like, how did you get there?
[258.72s -> 261.32s]  Like, what's your, what's your origin story?
[262.16s -> 265.80s]  So I grew up in Grenoble.
[265.80s -> 269.00s]  Grenoble is a small town in the Alps, the French Alps.
[269.36s -> 271.84s]  It's a city surrounded by mountains.
[272.08s -> 274.96s]  So of course I grew up like, you know, snowboarding.
[275.28s -> 279.16s]  It was also a famous city for its skateboard scene.
[279.44s -> 284.04s]  So, you know, I think the age of like 12 or 13, I, you know,
[284.04s -> 289.28s]  I started to skateboard and play music.
[289.28s -> 291.88s]  Like music is a big part of who I am.
[293.16s -> 297.28s]  Started to play drums when I was 14 and played in like, you know,
[298.16s -> 299.76s]  punk, heavy metal bands.
[300.28s -> 304.32s]  And yeah, I grew up in this environment surrounded by,
[304.32s -> 307.00s]  you know, skateboarding, snowboarding, music, punk rock.
[307.48s -> 308.56s]  It was great.
[308.56s -> 311.48s]  I'm super happy of like how I grew up.
[311.48s -> 317.72s]  And I was so super proud of like that scene I once belonged.
[317.72s -> 319.72s]  I guess today I still belong to that scene.
[319.72s -> 322.16s]  I just belong to that scene in a different way.
[322.52s -> 325.92s]  But like it really made me, I'm this person today
[325.96s -> 329.12s]  because all the things I've been through when I was like,
[329.12s -> 334.56s]  you know, from 11 when I discovered like Kill'em All to,
[334.56s -> 339.52s]  you know, to my 20s, you know, I was a big fan of like Zero
[339.52s -> 342.80s]  and like Jamie Thomas and you know, so all of that
[342.80s -> 345.16s]  like made the person I am today.
[345.16s -> 348.44s]  And I'm so happy that I can finally, you know,
[348.44s -> 354.00s]  like measure how important it was because when you're into it,
[354.72s -> 358.52s]  you don't really pay attention, you know, like at the time,
[358.52s -> 361.36s]  I didn't know like it was building me, you know,
[361.36s -> 367.32s]  and also like, you know, like I became also like very aware
[367.32s -> 371.88s]  of like culture during that moment of my life.
[371.88s -> 373.96s]  And still today, like I'm still,
[375.36s -> 377.24s]  I would say the same person,
[377.24s -> 381.08s]  like my foundation are really anchored
[381.08s -> 387.16s]  in my teenage, my teenager years in Grenoble.
[387.16s -> 390.44s]  It's a super, it's a super interesting point.
[390.44s -> 391.60s]  And I feel the same way.
[391.60s -> 394.96s]  I've often felt like I feel really lucky that I grew up
[394.96s -> 398.40s]  with sort of fringe culture that you consumed via VHS.
[398.40s -> 400.56s]  And, you know, like, you know, you had to,
[400.56s -> 403.04s]  you really had to seek your magazines, zines,
[403.04s -> 403.96s]  you had to search it out
[403.96s -> 405.72s]  because the internet made more sense to me.
[405.72s -> 408.64s]  I think if I would have only consumed mainstream culture,
[408.68s -> 411.92s]  the internet might have been more of a shock to my system.
[411.92s -> 415.92s]  But I think for those of us who like come from fringe culture,
[415.92s -> 417.36s]  you know, the internet, you know,
[417.36s -> 419.24s]  immediately seemed like a godsend.
[419.24s -> 422.72s]  Yes, I mean, I used to, I used to record the TV,
[422.72s -> 425.36s]  like to get some songs from like the new,
[425.36s -> 427.64s]  the New Deal skateboard video, you know.
[427.64s -> 429.56s]  There was this song I really, really loved,
[429.56s -> 431.60s]  and I couldn't find who it was.
[431.60s -> 435.72s]  And yeah, I was just recording over like the TV, you know.
[435.72s -> 440.36s]  So, you know, like you had really to,
[440.36s -> 443.24s]  of course, when the internet came, as you said,
[443.24s -> 446.28s]  like it made sense to us because it was a big fanzine,
[446.28s -> 450.56s]  you know, and it also like,
[450.56s -> 453.92s]  in a way like killed the underground because,
[453.92s -> 455.76s]  but we had like a new underground.
[455.76s -> 457.52s]  I mean, it's very difficult for me to explain,
[457.52s -> 461.84s]  but like I was happy of the internet.
[461.84s -> 463.36s]  I was not like, oh, internet sucks.
[463.52s -> 466.68s]  I miss my like paper printing magazine.
[466.68s -> 469.16s]  I still love my printed paper magazine,
[469.16s -> 472.16s]  but I loved and I still love the internet.
[472.16s -> 476.96s]  So it's just, you know,
[476.96s -> 480.92s]  it brings up all the potential of our culture,
[480.92s -> 484.16s]  of the fanzines, of the scene I was into.
[484.16s -> 487.84s]  And also, finally, I was not isolated.
[487.84s -> 491.08s]  Like in my hometown, we were like five strategy kids,
[491.60s -> 494.64s]  and, you know, and 15 skateboarders.
[494.64s -> 496.76s]  But once I got the internet, you know,
[496.76s -> 499.32s]  I was chatting with some like a strategy kids
[499.32s -> 500.80s]  from like Boston, you know,
[500.80s -> 503.16s]  and I was like, oh, I'm not alone.
[503.16s -> 505.40s]  And then I could like order like some magazines
[505.40s -> 508.00s]  and some fanzines and get my head on the first,
[508.00s -> 511.36s]  like the heart attack hardcore magazines
[511.36s -> 512.48s]  and stuff like this.
[512.48s -> 516.00s]  So it's just mind blowing when you're like a teenager
[516.00s -> 516.96s]  and you're building yourself,
[516.96s -> 520.28s]  you're building your culture.
[520.28s -> 521.72s]  It's just amazing.
[521.72s -> 525.68s]  I think so much of your story is similar to mine
[525.68s -> 526.60s]  in that way, right?
[526.60s -> 528.80s]  You were in Grenoble, I was in Goshen, Indiana.
[528.80s -> 530.76s]  I'm a couple of years older than you.
[532.12s -> 534.64s]  But I think the thing that's so unique about you
[534.64s -> 537.68s]  for me that makes you unlike any person I've ever met
[537.68s -> 539.64s]  and really so important to me
[539.64s -> 541.56s]  when I moved here to Paris was
[541.56s -> 543.28s]  I moved here to work at LVMH.
[543.28s -> 547.08s]  I knew absolutely nothing about fashion
[547.08s -> 548.88s]  or as Mike D said at the time,
[548.88s -> 550.48s]  like Ian, everything you know about fashion,
[550.48s -> 552.84s]  you learned from Jay-Z songs.
[552.84s -> 555.76s]  But you, you were, suddenly I had this friend
[555.76s -> 557.72s]  who grew up with, you know,
[557.72s -> 560.20s]  listening to metal and punk rock and skateboarding
[560.20s -> 561.80s]  who I could call and say,
[561.80s -> 563.20s]  what do you think of the Dior show?
[563.20s -> 566.16s]  And you had actually like a thoughtful,
[566.16s -> 569.40s]  nuanced, insightful opinion.
[569.40s -> 571.40s]  So you also, you know,
[571.40s -> 574.12s]  know a lot about the fashion world and you know,
[574.12s -> 575.80s]  so why is that?
[575.80s -> 577.88s]  That's not usual for someone who comes
[577.88s -> 580.88s]  from the scenes that you and I come from.
[580.88s -> 581.72s]  No, it's true.
[581.72s -> 584.72s]  It's very, very niche, very unique, I think.
[586.32s -> 587.16s]  It comes from-
[587.16s -> 590.28s]  I've never been, I've never been shopping at,
[591.60s -> 593.88s]  you know, at YSL or Celine
[593.88s -> 596.56s]  with any of my other skateboard friends.
[596.56s -> 598.52s]  But you and I have actually done that.
[598.52s -> 600.04s]  Yes, true, true.
[600.04s -> 604.36s]  No, I think, I mean, it's a pretty unique,
[604.36s -> 607.12s]  I think my, like the way I grew up again
[607.12s -> 608.88s]  is a pretty unique configuration.
[608.88s -> 613.60s]  Like my dad had a jeans company in the 80s.
[613.60s -> 616.68s]  So basically I grew up going to like free markets,
[616.68s -> 621.04s]  looking for like a military collectible,
[621.04s -> 622.68s]  like army pants and jackets.
[622.68s -> 625.60s]  So I've learned about like not fashion
[625.60s -> 627.92s]  because again, I always say the same thing,
[627.92s -> 630.72s]  but I'm not, I don't care about fashion.
[630.72s -> 632.04s]  I'm not obsessed with fashion.
[632.04s -> 633.28s]  I like products.
[633.28s -> 635.40s]  I like a product with a function.
[636.40s -> 638.04s]  I like culture.
[638.04s -> 639.60s]  I like products.
[639.60s -> 644.60s]  Like a big part why I like, you know, clothes
[645.00s -> 650.00s]  is like how kids have interpreted looks and clothes.
[651.76s -> 654.48s]  Like, you know, like the skinhead with a bomber jacket.
[654.48s -> 656.60s]  You know, they use a bomber jacket
[656.60s -> 659.20s]  because the fabric was so slippery
[659.20s -> 661.80s]  that they couldn't get caught by the cops.
[661.80s -> 663.28s]  You know, that's time.
[663.28s -> 664.12s]  They shaved their hair
[664.12s -> 667.32s]  because again, they couldn't get caught by the cops.
[667.32s -> 671.40s]  The perfecto jacket, it's a flight jacket.
[671.40s -> 673.36s]  It's a jacket for the army, you know.
[673.36s -> 675.32s]  And this was punk.
[675.32s -> 676.88s]  Like you go to the army shop
[676.88s -> 679.60s]  and then you take what belongs to the army
[679.60s -> 682.44s]  and you wear it to protest against the army.
[682.44s -> 683.72s]  That's super punk.
[683.72s -> 686.24s]  And this is what I like about like fashion.
[686.24s -> 689.40s]  It's like just identity.
[689.40s -> 692.32s]  You show who you are, what you stand for.
[692.36s -> 694.36s]  And for me, this is what matters the most.
[694.36s -> 699.36s]  I am very not into like design is the sake of design.
[700.16s -> 704.44s]  You are not into like the, you know, like,
[704.44s -> 705.92s]  I mean, there are some great designers
[705.92s -> 708.16s]  and they can reinvent styles,
[708.16s -> 711.32s]  but it's not something that moves me.
[711.32s -> 713.72s]  I'm much more moved by someone
[713.72s -> 718.72s]  who's going to take ownership about like something,
[719.12s -> 721.00s]  like a culture and transform it
[721.04s -> 722.80s]  into like something different.
[722.80s -> 726.32s]  I like a, I like a reappropriation of things.
[726.32s -> 730.92s]  And I think this was my connection with fashion.
[730.92s -> 735.60s]  I was not obsessed with like the LVMH brand or Louis Vuitton.
[735.60s -> 736.52s]  I think, you know, of course,
[736.52s -> 739.08s]  like I like the craftsmanship behind it,
[739.08s -> 741.72s]  but I was more obsessed by, you know,
[741.72s -> 743.72s]  the face magazine and ID magazine,
[743.72s -> 746.04s]  like all this like British scene,
[746.04s -> 750.56s]  which was still punk in the late 90s and early 2000.
[750.56s -> 752.84s]  You know, like transforming vintage stuff
[752.84s -> 754.40s]  into like new products.
[754.40s -> 759.40s]  And just, you know, like just, yeah.
[761.24s -> 765.48s]  You know, I think the clothes and fashion
[765.48s -> 768.56s]  are just a way to reveal yourself.
[768.56s -> 770.60s]  It should not be the opposite, you know.
[770.60s -> 773.60s]  You shouldn't hide with fashion,
[773.60s -> 774.64s]  like hide yourself with fashion.
[774.64s -> 778.32s]  It's just way to emphasize who you are.
[778.60s -> 782.40s]  And I like, I guess this is what I like with fashion.
[782.40s -> 785.76s]  So this approach, plus of course,
[785.76s -> 787.84s]  my culture was like, you know,
[787.84s -> 790.04s]  whatever skateboard music and stuff,
[790.04s -> 792.96s]  create this thing you have right now in front of you
[794.36s -> 797.84s]  with all his contradictions.
[797.84s -> 799.40s]  And yeah.
[801.32s -> 804.24s]  I remember when I first met you,
[804.24s -> 808.08s]  I did some shopping at the April 77 store,
[808.84s -> 809.68s]  which no longer exists,
[809.68s -> 812.48s]  but I loved the like, you made awesome jeans,
[812.48s -> 814.40s]  but they had a guitar pick holster,
[814.40s -> 816.80s]  which is so fun and so cool.
[816.80s -> 819.40s]  And by the way, Kyle still basically only,
[819.40s -> 821.76s]  my husband still only wears those jeans
[821.76s -> 824.24s]  and it's like his favorite conversation starter, right?
[824.24s -> 825.64s]  Which is like, whoa,
[825.64s -> 827.56s]  do those have a guitar pick holster?
[827.56s -> 829.40s]  But I love that because right at like,
[829.40s -> 832.08s]  like it calls back to that history, right?
[832.08s -> 834.40s]  Into that like story of how you,
[834.40s -> 836.44s]  like of the things that were important to you,
[836.44s -> 837.92s]  you know, like you could be in a rock band
[838.76s -> 840.92s]  and wear these jeans and they provide utility, right?
[840.92s -> 845.48s]  So now, so now what you're doing is,
[845.48s -> 846.84s]  you know, making running clothes,
[846.84s -> 849.28s]  which is another passion that I know that you
[849.28s -> 851.80s]  and dad both share, you know,
[851.80s -> 854.76s]  skateboarding, snowboarding, now distance running,
[854.76s -> 856.04s]  which I think is bonkers,
[856.04s -> 858.20s]  but it's cool that you guys like it.
[858.20s -> 859.64s]  By the way, as we know,
[859.64s -> 861.40s]  Zoe and I have run a marathon together.
[861.40s -> 863.08s]  So she's actually quality.
[863.08s -> 864.56s]  She's almost died.
[864.56s -> 865.92s]  I think that 26 miles,
[865.92s -> 867.44s]  I turned to Zoe and I said,
[868.48s -> 869.88s]  should we quit?
[869.88s -> 871.72s]  We really wanna finish this thing?
[871.72s -> 874.36s]  No, but so she is qualified to call it bonkers.
[874.36s -> 875.20s]  That's my point.
[875.20s -> 876.04s]  I'm qualified.
[876.04s -> 877.36s]  But yeah, so, but anyways,
[877.36s -> 878.80s]  so then I just wanted to like,
[878.80s -> 880.92s]  so like, let's dig in a little bit to satisfy.
[880.92s -> 883.04s]  So you're like building,
[883.04s -> 885.44s]  you've built this new brand and you know,
[885.44s -> 886.92s]  tell us a little bit about kind of like
[886.92s -> 889.52s]  the philosophy behind it and where it's at now.
[889.52s -> 891.20s]  Yeah, we're talking about like the jeans
[891.20s -> 892.28s]  and the functionality.
[892.28s -> 895.44s]  Like I like when things have a purpose,
[896.20s -> 897.68s]  and I have a function,
[897.68s -> 902.00s]  but I found running late in my life,
[902.00s -> 904.16s]  maybe too late in my life now, I think,
[904.16s -> 906.52s]  but no, never too late.
[906.52s -> 907.68s]  Okay, great.
[907.68s -> 909.88s]  I found running in my mid thirties
[909.88s -> 912.20s]  and I became completely obsessed with running.
[913.56s -> 915.84s]  You know, like started to,
[915.84s -> 918.36s]  I still remember my first run, you know,
[918.36s -> 920.56s]  like a 5K,
[920.56s -> 923.08s]  what Vincent, 6 a.m.
[923.12s -> 926.60s]  was just game changing,
[926.60s -> 927.88s]  but also I really,
[927.88s -> 929.56s]  it was at the time of my life
[929.56s -> 933.40s]  when I really wanted to step out from my comfort zone.
[933.40s -> 934.88s]  I've been doing like this jeans thing
[934.88s -> 936.96s]  for like 20 years and you know, like,
[936.96s -> 938.36s]  okay, now what's next?
[938.36s -> 941.44s]  And I'm, you know,
[941.44s -> 944.36s]  I'm a builder.
[944.36s -> 945.68s]  Like I like to build things, you know,
[945.68s -> 946.92s]  and since I'm a kid,
[946.92s -> 948.24s]  I've been building, you know,
[948.24s -> 950.68s]  like RC cars.
[950.68s -> 952.64s]  I used to build like robots.
[953.16s -> 954.64s]  I used to invent games.
[954.64s -> 958.20s]  Like I love to create and to build stuff.
[958.20s -> 960.32s]  I just have a quick question for you.
[960.32s -> 962.24s]  When did you stop building RC cars?
[964.44s -> 966.48s]  Yeah, yeah.
[966.48s -> 969.08s]  But you know, it's like if you walk,
[969.08s -> 971.32s]  if you go to a guitar store, you know,
[971.32s -> 972.64s]  you want to buy a guitar.
[972.64s -> 975.44s]  So that thing with like RC car stores is the same.
[975.44s -> 977.88s]  Like every time I was stopping by a RC car store,
[977.88s -> 980.44s]  I was like, oh, I want like a new RC car.
[980.44s -> 981.44s]  But like, yeah, it's true.
[981.44s -> 983.96s]  Like I got back to it like a few months ago
[983.96s -> 985.48s]  and I'm completely obsessed with it
[985.48s -> 987.52s]  because I can't do things just,
[987.52s -> 988.80s]  I can't be chill about things.
[988.80s -> 990.00s]  I have to be here.
[990.00s -> 991.76s]  Like, you know, like I like coffee.
[991.76s -> 993.04s]  I had to open a coffee shop.
[993.04s -> 994.12s]  Oh, I like the Ramones.
[994.12s -> 996.88s]  I have to build a company that makes skinny jeans.
[996.88s -> 997.72s]  I like running.
[997.72s -> 998.88s]  Oh, I'm going to make satisfied.
[998.88s -> 1000.76s]  So it's something in my mind,
[1000.76s -> 1004.44s]  which is, you know, which works a bit like,
[1004.44s -> 1006.04s]  I mean, the way I'm cabled,
[1006.04s -> 1009.40s]  I'm wired is a bit like this,
[1009.40s -> 1012.84s]  but like I'm, you know, I embrace it, I guess.
[1012.84s -> 1014.40s]  Anything worth doing is worth overdoing.
[1014.40s -> 1015.24s]  Exactly.
[1016.20s -> 1019.88s]  And so I'm a builder.
[1019.88s -> 1022.28s]  And so when I started to run,
[1022.28s -> 1024.88s]  I became of course obsessed with running, you know.
[1026.76s -> 1031.76s]  And the downside was I,
[1033.40s -> 1034.92s]  coming from where I come from,
[1034.92s -> 1037.24s]  like this like cultural thing,
[1037.24s -> 1041.60s]  like skateboard, music, like craftsmanship,
[1041.60s -> 1043.08s]  like April 7th was, you know,
[1043.08s -> 1046.44s]  was a very nice brand with fabrics from Japan,
[1046.44s -> 1048.96s]  made in Europe, like it was a beautiful brand.
[1048.96s -> 1051.04s]  And I had this knowledge of fabrics
[1051.04s -> 1052.72s]  and like how to make products.
[1052.72s -> 1055.04s]  And I was like, okay, now I'm a runner,
[1055.04s -> 1057.76s]  but like, do I, like,
[1057.76s -> 1061.52s]  I couldn't find myself in the actual offer,
[1061.52s -> 1063.36s]  both in terms of product,
[1063.36s -> 1067.80s]  which were to like, was commodity for me,
[1067.80s -> 1069.48s]  but also in terms of culture,
[1069.48s -> 1071.36s]  like as a skateboarder,
[1071.36s -> 1074.28s]  like when you switch from like a skateboard scene
[1074.28s -> 1077.04s]  to the running scenes, like it's lame,
[1077.04s -> 1079.32s]  there's no offense for like, you know,
[1079.32s -> 1081.40s]  the older runners and the running scene,
[1081.40s -> 1084.32s]  but like at the time it was lame.
[1084.32s -> 1088.72s]  And it was all about like a performance,
[1088.72s -> 1091.44s]  you know, like running fast or you can do it.
[1091.44s -> 1096.16s]  But my approach of performance was way more romantic.
[1096.16s -> 1099.52s]  Like I experienced, you know,
[1099.52s -> 1100.96s]  what we call like the runner's high,
[1100.96s -> 1102.64s]  like it's a beautiful moment, you know,
[1102.64s -> 1104.72s]  your brain is floating, you know,
[1104.72s -> 1106.52s]  and you're like, oh wow, this is amazing.
[1106.52s -> 1110.20s]  Like, you know, like I was reinventing myself.
[1110.20s -> 1111.88s]  It's amazing, it's an amazing feeling
[1111.88s -> 1113.40s]  to reinvent yourself.
[1113.40s -> 1116.04s]  And I wanted to talk about it.
[1116.04s -> 1119.44s]  And the way I talk about things is like making things.
[1119.44s -> 1122.24s]  And for me, like doing a Satisfy brand
[1122.24s -> 1126.60s]  was the right medium to use
[1126.60s -> 1128.88s]  if I wanted to share my experience,
[1128.88s -> 1130.88s]  but also to share my creativity
[1130.88s -> 1134.80s]  and my knowledge behind the products.
[1134.80s -> 1139.80s]  And so I created Satisfy in 2015 from scratch.
[1140.12s -> 1144.28s]  And I basically, my idea, my dream,
[1144.28s -> 1145.44s]  and it's still my dream,
[1145.44s -> 1147.68s]  was to make products
[1147.68s -> 1150.96s]  that will help you as a runner to reach the high.
[1150.96s -> 1154.60s]  Like my idea of performance was how can I get high?
[1154.60s -> 1156.88s]  Not like, how can I run fast?
[1156.88s -> 1159.28s]  You know, I don't care how fast I can be.
[1159.28s -> 1161.36s]  It's really more about the journey,
[1161.36s -> 1162.80s]  about the experience.
[1162.80s -> 1166.68s]  And I believe that the product we make
[1166.68s -> 1169.76s]  will inspire you to become a runner.
[1169.76s -> 1171.16s]  Or if you're already a runner,
[1171.16s -> 1174.68s]  will inspire you to reach different highs.
[1174.68s -> 1179.68s]  And that's what I've been working on since 2015,
[1181.92s -> 1185.04s]  making products like super-performant products,
[1186.16s -> 1188.84s]  making them, of course, in a very sustainable way,
[1188.84s -> 1191.44s]  using and developing our own fabrics
[1191.44s -> 1193.28s]  in France, in Europe, in Italy,
[1194.12s -> 1198.72s]  producing 90% of the production is based in Portugal.
[1198.72s -> 1203.72s]  So having this very boutique brand
[1205.68s -> 1207.56s]  I don't like the word niche,
[1207.56s -> 1211.24s]  because to me it doesn't really mean anything,
[1211.24s -> 1214.00s]  but very directional.
[1214.00s -> 1214.84s]  It's a running brand.
[1214.84s -> 1215.68s]  You know, we're not a life,
[1215.68s -> 1218.16s]  we're not like a streetwear brand,
[1218.16s -> 1219.88s]  or you know, we are a running brand.
[1219.88s -> 1223.28s]  And fair enough, if you want to wear the product
[1223.28s -> 1225.24s]  for hiking or climbing,
[1225.24s -> 1229.32s]  what people actually does.
[1229.32s -> 1231.76s]  But it's a very directional brand.
[1231.76s -> 1236.76s]  And yeah, so far it's been an amazing adventure,
[1239.16s -> 1244.16s]  both personally, but also working with an amazing team,
[1244.60s -> 1245.92s]  and being based in Paris,
[1245.92s -> 1249.40s]  the challenge of building an outdoor brand in Paris
[1249.40s -> 1252.72s]  is kind of like, I find it a prank.
[1254.92s -> 1258.92s]  Well, and also, and I'll say that you've been successful.
[1258.96s -> 1262.60s]  I mean, you've, and I want to try to tie this together
[1262.60s -> 1264.88s]  and touch more on the brand building,
[1264.88s -> 1266.40s]  because I think it's where,
[1266.40s -> 1268.40s]  I think you really have a lot to offer others
[1268.40s -> 1271.48s]  in the space in terms of experience
[1271.48s -> 1274.12s]  and expertise and inspiration.
[1275.00s -> 1277.80s]  But you know, I've watched your brand grow
[1277.80s -> 1280.20s]  firsthand for the last eight years.
[1280.20s -> 1282.68s]  And I know that you say no to a lot of things,
[1282.68s -> 1284.28s]  and yet you still, you know,
[1284.28s -> 1287.44s]  you've just done collaborations
[1287.44s -> 1290.40s]  with people like Oakley and Crocs,
[1290.40s -> 1292.48s]  and I would say some more,
[1292.48s -> 1294.12s]  but I don't know which ones are out
[1294.12s -> 1295.16s]  and which ones aren't,
[1295.16s -> 1298.56s]  but you know, the top brands in the world.
[1298.56s -> 1301.12s]  And I have this memory of when
[1301.12s -> 1303.24s]  we were at the Berlin Marathon,
[1303.24s -> 1304.84s]  and I met some Nike folks,
[1304.84s -> 1307.48s]  and they sort of like whispered to me,
[1307.48s -> 1309.20s]  we wish we could make this.
[1309.20s -> 1311.24s]  Like, this is what we wish we could do.
[1311.24s -> 1313.56s]  And I think you really, you know,
[1313.56s -> 1315.24s]  found a hole in the market.
[1315.24s -> 1318.08s]  But you know, for all the reasons that you said,
[1318.08s -> 1320.16s]  because you know, if you're someone like us,
[1320.16s -> 1322.96s]  and you know, and running is really about,
[1322.96s -> 1324.24s]  you know, for me, you know,
[1324.24s -> 1326.28s]  running is that most important meeting of the day.
[1326.28s -> 1328.28s]  You know, I got out of bed at 6.30 this morning
[1328.28s -> 1330.72s]  and did my 11K loop,
[1330.72s -> 1333.44s]  and it's literally the most important meeting of my day.
[1333.44s -> 1335.84s]  I like actually, it's the only kind of moment
[1335.84s -> 1340.12s]  of clarity that I'll have today in a way probably.
[1340.12s -> 1341.80s]  And that's not about, you know,
[1341.80s -> 1344.52s]  something that looks like Olympic gear.
[1344.52s -> 1346.60s]  You know, it's actually something, you know,
[1346.60s -> 1348.28s]  like I always said, you know, it looks like, you know,
[1348.28s -> 1350.52s]  Scott Campbell with his shirt off in the mountains,
[1350.52s -> 1352.56s]  you know, much more than it, you know,
[1352.56s -> 1357.12s]  than it looks like, you know, an Olympic athlete.
[1357.12s -> 1360.72s]  So I really identify with the hole that you identified
[1360.72s -> 1363.76s]  in the market, which is obviously personal.
[1364.72s -> 1366.80s]  I think the thing that I would like to be sure
[1366.80s -> 1369.60s]  that people kind of get, I think first of all,
[1369.60s -> 1371.36s]  you've already laid it out there in terms of like,
[1371.36s -> 1373.40s]  you're a very unique person.
[1373.40s -> 1376.12s]  You're also obviously an obsessive person.
[1376.12s -> 1378.40s]  So thanks for getting that out there for us too,
[1378.40s -> 1381.20s]  because, you know, I know you as a workaholic
[1381.20s -> 1384.56s]  and that we should definitely talk about.
[1384.56s -> 1388.52s]  But what I see is I see people trying to create brands
[1388.52s -> 1390.72s]  in this kind of emerging web three space,
[1390.72s -> 1393.36s]  which is about five minutes old.
[1393.36s -> 1395.40s]  And people are already like, you know,
[1395.40s -> 1397.72s]  calling them the greatest brand in the world
[1397.72s -> 1399.00s]  or the worst brand in the world,
[1399.00s -> 1401.32s]  depending on the week.
[1401.32s -> 1405.64s]  And, you know, what I've really seen watching you
[1405.64s -> 1408.64s]  is exactly how long it takes to build a brand.
[1408.64s -> 1410.48s]  And then I pattern matched that a little bit
[1410.48s -> 1413.56s]  against things like, you know, the story of Golden Goose,
[1413.56s -> 1415.92s]  which is, you know, I think they're,
[1415.92s -> 1418.52s]  I don't know the exact, you know, numbers.
[1418.52s -> 1420.24s]  I have known, but I've forgotten them.
[1420.24s -> 1423.04s]  But, you know, it took them sort of 15 years
[1423.04s -> 1425.76s]  to build an interesting business.
[1425.76s -> 1428.76s]  And then in the sort of 12 or so years since,
[1428.76s -> 1430.44s]  they've built a big business, right?
[1430.44s -> 1434.00s]  So, and I would argue that without that first 15 years
[1434.00s -> 1435.40s]  of really building, as you said,
[1435.40s -> 1436.44s]  you don't like the word niche,
[1436.44s -> 1440.60s]  but, you know, at first it starts with a core audience,
[1440.60s -> 1441.44s]  right?
[1441.44s -> 1442.64s]  And then without that core audience,
[1442.64s -> 1444.72s]  you can never kind of get beyond.
[1444.72s -> 1447.24s]  I would argue that it's maybe even generational, right?
[1447.24s -> 1449.96s]  If Golden Goose hadn't been around long enough
[1449.96s -> 1452.40s]  for someone like Virgil Abloh to be like,
[1452.40s -> 1454.36s]  yo, that was my shit when I was 16,
[1454.36s -> 1455.80s]  I'm not sure that, you know,
[1455.80s -> 1458.76s]  that they could have become what they are.
[1458.80s -> 1460.84s]  And I'm seeing something similar, you know,
[1460.84s -> 1464.40s]  watching Gabriela Hurst and the way that she builds,
[1464.40s -> 1466.44s]  you know, her eponymous brand,
[1466.44s -> 1469.28s]  but also, you know, does other things like Chloe,
[1469.28s -> 1470.24s]  et cetera.
[1470.24s -> 1472.44s]  And you could argue even the same for Jonathan Anderson.
[1472.44s -> 1474.52s]  JW Anderson is a relatively small brand.
[1474.52s -> 1476.12s]  It's been around for a very long time
[1476.12s -> 1478.00s]  and done very interesting things,
[1478.00s -> 1479.88s]  but it's still very small,
[1479.88s -> 1481.76s]  if you put it next to even the brand
[1481.76s -> 1485.00s]  that Jonathan is a designer at La Huebe, right?
[1485.00s -> 1488.44s]  And so my, what I've really learned
[1488.44s -> 1492.20s]  is that building brands takes a long time.
[1492.20s -> 1495.60s]  And then what I see people trying to do
[1495.60s -> 1497.44s]  is to build brands overnight.
[1497.44s -> 1498.80s]  And I think if I could, you know,
[1498.80s -> 1503.56s]  I really wanted, you know, to get people,
[1503.56s -> 1507.04s]  maybe get people's heads around just how long it takes
[1507.04s -> 1509.44s]  to build a real brand.
[1509.44s -> 1510.96s]  And I'd love to hear from you
[1510.96s -> 1513.20s]  and how you think about that
[1513.20s -> 1516.48s]  and how you think about like the timetable
[1516.48s -> 1517.68s]  of Satisfy, right?
[1517.72s -> 1519.44s]  Like what, you know,
[1519.44s -> 1521.56s]  how much patience do you need to have
[1521.56s -> 1523.20s]  to do what it is you're doing?
[1523.20s -> 1526.72s]  Yeah, it's, but you said it all.
[1526.72s -> 1530.88s]  It's long because, I mean,
[1532.00s -> 1534.80s]  you can build a brand or you can be like a brand.
[1534.80s -> 1538.08s]  You know, like you, what we try,
[1538.08s -> 1540.68s]  what I try to do is, I mean, first of all,
[1540.68s -> 1542.96s]  like, you know, you name the Gabriella Hearst
[1542.96s -> 1544.52s]  or Jonathan Anderson, you know,
[1544.52s -> 1546.96s]  like it's interesting because
[1547.00s -> 1549.92s]  they have their own name on the product, you know?
[1549.92s -> 1554.84s]  And I think there's also like a psychological thing,
[1554.84s -> 1558.20s]  connection, like you're going to be the face,
[1558.20s -> 1559.80s]  you are the face of your brand.
[1559.80s -> 1561.72s]  So it's really who you are.
[1561.72s -> 1563.64s]  And you don't want to,
[1563.64s -> 1567.04s]  you don't want to jeopardize with your identity.
[1567.04s -> 1568.68s]  And I feel the same with Satisfy.
[1568.68s -> 1571.16s]  It's not my name, but it's my baby, you know?
[1571.16s -> 1575.12s]  So I will do everything to make the brand
[1575.12s -> 1577.12s]  to last as long as possible.
[1577.12s -> 1582.12s]  I really want Satisfy to live longer than I will live,
[1582.44s -> 1583.28s]  you know?
[1583.28s -> 1587.64s]  And I'm building a brand that hopefully
[1587.64s -> 1589.60s]  will live for like, you know, like 100 years.
[1589.60s -> 1591.60s]  I don't know, you know, but like this,
[1591.60s -> 1593.08s]  you have to think like this,
[1593.08s -> 1598.08s]  like I'm not building like, you know, like,
[1598.44s -> 1600.68s]  it's not like an overnight sensation, you know?
[1600.68s -> 1604.28s]  You don't like, you could do this.
[1604.28s -> 1606.76s]  And I think some people are really good at doing this,
[1606.76s -> 1611.76s]  you know, like having a brand that makes like millions,
[1613.64s -> 1614.48s]  like short term.
[1614.48s -> 1616.36s]  I mean, you have this also in the music industry,
[1616.36s -> 1618.48s]  you know, you can do this, it's a choice.
[1618.48s -> 1620.16s]  It's not my choice.
[1620.16s -> 1625.16s]  I want to be the brand and to be true to who I am.
[1625.48s -> 1627.20s]  I think this is very important,
[1627.20s -> 1632.20s]  but also when you do brands like Satisfy,
[1632.60s -> 1637.48s]  it's a brand for passionate people, for runners.
[1637.48s -> 1641.16s]  And it just takes time.
[1641.16s -> 1645.44s]  Like this industry, like the space we are in,
[1646.36s -> 1649.68s]  by definition, is very slow.
[1649.68s -> 1652.84s]  Like it's a product that is performant.
[1652.84s -> 1655.60s]  It's a product that also can save lives, you know?
[1655.60s -> 1657.56s]  Imagine you go to the mountains
[1657.56s -> 1659.72s]  and you need like a three-layer jacket.
[1659.72s -> 1662.08s]  Like the product can actually save your life.
[1662.92s -> 1664.40s]  So you need to put also a lot of energy,
[1664.40s -> 1666.60s]  time and money into development.
[1666.60s -> 1670.20s]  So before you will be ready, anyway,
[1670.20s -> 1673.24s]  you still have like a three, four years of development.
[1673.24s -> 1678.08s]  Like today, I can like happily say that we,
[1678.08s -> 1681.00s]  I mean, our products are really good
[1681.00s -> 1682.92s]  and like can save life.
[1682.92s -> 1685.76s]  And we, you know, we are actually,
[1685.76s -> 1687.44s]  I really believe that our products
[1687.44s -> 1688.80s]  are one of the best on the market.
[1688.80s -> 1691.00s]  But it took me like eight years.
[1691.00s -> 1694.36s]  And so because my space wants this.
[1694.36s -> 1696.56s]  Now, if I'm building like a T-shirt brand
[1696.56s -> 1698.56s]  or I'm building like something else,
[1699.68s -> 1700.76s]  yeah, it's possible.
[1700.76s -> 1702.76s]  It's just a matter of like who you are,
[1702.76s -> 1703.96s]  what you want to do.
[1703.96s -> 1707.64s]  But I don't call this like overnight sensation,
[1707.64s -> 1709.12s]  like brands to me.
[1709.12s -> 1712.04s]  For me, a brand is an entity
[1712.04s -> 1715.84s]  that creates like emotional connections
[1715.84s -> 1718.20s]  with its audience on the long term.
[1718.20s -> 1720.20s]  And you want to evolve with the brand.
[1720.20s -> 1724.00s]  And again, my references are like the skate brands
[1724.00s -> 1725.36s]  I grew up with, you know,
[1725.36s -> 1727.56s]  and some very like, you know,
[1727.56s -> 1728.92s]  like underground brand,
[1728.92s -> 1730.00s]  like I can name them, you know,
[1730.00s -> 1731.72s]  like I mean, of course,
[1731.72s -> 1734.96s]  like Gouge, but also like Volcom,
[1734.96s -> 1736.12s]  like in the beginning, you know,
[1736.12s -> 1739.44s]  like Fecht, I was a huge fan of Fecht.
[1739.44s -> 1742.24s]  I was a huge, and Fecht is like super delusional,
[1742.24s -> 1743.40s]  super specific,
[1743.40s -> 1745.48s]  but I grew up with that brand.
[1745.48s -> 1748.08s]  And it's funny because I brought to Eric
[1748.52s -> 1750.80s]  from Fecht a few months ago,
[1750.80s -> 1751.96s]  and I told him like,
[1751.96s -> 1754.24s]  I do what I'm doing because of you.
[1754.24s -> 1755.96s]  Like when I was 16,
[1755.96s -> 1759.84s]  I sent a letter to Eric and his brother of Fecht
[1759.84s -> 1764.00s]  because I wanted to open the record label,
[1764.00s -> 1765.28s]  the Fecht record label.
[1765.28s -> 1767.08s]  I was like, oh, this brand is amazing.
[1767.08s -> 1769.60s]  This brand needs a record label.
[1769.60s -> 1771.32s]  And I thought I had the idea,
[1771.32s -> 1774.28s]  but like, so Eric referred back to me
[1774.28s -> 1775.56s]  like a few months ago, he was like,
[1776.00s -> 1778.24s]  we already had the record label.
[1779.20s -> 1780.44s]  It was not called Fecht,
[1780.44s -> 1782.60s]  but like, so it makes sense
[1782.60s -> 1784.20s]  that it was so aligned with this guy.
[1784.20s -> 1786.12s]  So for me, that's a brand, you know,
[1786.12s -> 1789.36s]  it creates like a game changing
[1791.16s -> 1794.68s]  emotional connection with its audience.
[1794.68s -> 1799.36s]  And this takes time,
[1799.36s -> 1800.60s]  because as a human,
[1800.60s -> 1802.28s]  you're going to evolve with a brand, you know,
[1802.28s -> 1804.00s]  it's like, it's a life,
[1804.44s -> 1807.28s]  a brand is like a life companion.
[1807.28s -> 1810.76s]  Like Bob Dylan is our life companion, you know,
[1810.76s -> 1815.56s]  like, you know, it's just that level.
[1815.56s -> 1818.28s]  And this is what I want to build with Satisfied,
[1818.28s -> 1822.24s]  that level of emotion.
[1822.24s -> 1824.48s]  A brand is a life companion.
[1824.48s -> 1825.92s]  I mean, I think that to me,
[1825.92s -> 1828.80s]  this is why I really wanted to have this conversation
[1828.80s -> 1830.48s]  in this space where we're doing this thing
[1830.48s -> 1832.32s]  with Ledger and FWB,
[1832.40s -> 1834.28s]  because I think that there are a lot of people
[1834.28s -> 1835.56s]  in these communities
[1835.56s -> 1838.16s]  that are trying to build new brands, right?
[1838.16s -> 1839.48s]  What I always say about Ledger is,
[1839.48s -> 1841.48s]  I don't want to build the future with the past,
[1841.48s -> 1844.44s]  you know, I want to use new things.
[1844.44s -> 1846.00s]  And I think, you know, I mean,
[1846.00s -> 1848.48s]  I've learned so much from you
[1848.48s -> 1850.40s]  over the past eight years.
[1850.40s -> 1853.08s]  And with this, you're encapsulating it.
[1853.08s -> 1854.76s]  It's so natural for you,
[1854.76s -> 1857.68s]  which I think is also important for people to hear,
[1857.68s -> 1859.12s]  because I think it's probably,
[1859.12s -> 1860.88s]  there are people out there that want to build brands
[1860.88s -> 1862.24s]  and they're probably listening to you
[1863.12s -> 1863.96s]  and saying like, oh, wow,
[1863.96s -> 1866.08s]  like this guy just sort of instinctively knows how to do it
[1866.08s -> 1868.04s]  and I wish I did.
[1868.04s -> 1870.60s]  But I'm also, you know, trying to convey bits of it
[1870.60s -> 1872.36s]  that might be useful to them.
[1872.36s -> 1873.40s]  You know, for example,
[1873.40s -> 1876.04s]  I think that just that patience that you need
[1876.04s -> 1879.52s]  to kind of build a brand that, you know,
[1879.52s -> 1881.04s]  lasts that long.
[1882.44s -> 1884.84s]  And whereas I think some people think like,
[1884.84s -> 1887.72s]  you know, well, I dropped one collection
[1887.72s -> 1888.96s]  and no one liked it.
[1888.96s -> 1890.64s]  Shit, what do I do now?
[1890.64s -> 1893.20s]  I didn't have enough money for a second collection.
[1893.20s -> 1897.40s]  And that brings me to sort of the practical side of it
[1897.40s -> 1899.12s]  for you, like to start Satisfy,
[1899.12s -> 1901.76s]  you actually stopped doing another brand,
[1901.76s -> 1904.76s]  which is a big life decision for you personally.
[1905.96s -> 1907.36s]  I also, like I said earlier,
[1907.36s -> 1908.68s]  I know you're a workaholic.
[1908.68s -> 1910.28s]  I call you on a Friday night and I'm like,
[1910.28s -> 1911.12s]  hey, what's up?
[1911.12s -> 1912.84s]  And you're like, oh, I'm in the office.
[1912.84s -> 1915.80s]  So, you know, I can talk to you on Saturday morning.
[1915.80s -> 1917.44s]  Yeah, I'm going to work today, right?
[1917.44s -> 1919.24s]  So I think some people simply,
[1919.24s -> 1921.04s]  I see the work that you put in
[1921.04s -> 1923.28s]  and some people simply aren't,
[1923.28s -> 1925.64s]  they don't have the ethic and they aren't as obsessive.
[1925.64s -> 1927.24s]  You know, I know it's not actually work for you
[1927.24s -> 1930.00s]  and it's like, you know, you have to do it.
[1931.12s -> 1934.00s]  But also I think that there's another piece
[1934.00s -> 1935.92s]  that you have to get right here, right?
[1935.92s -> 1938.60s]  Because you're also, you're building a company,
[1938.60s -> 1940.48s]  you're building a team,
[1940.48s -> 1943.36s]  you're, you know, you're raising money,
[1943.36s -> 1947.68s]  you're, you know, you have wholesalers and resellers.
[1947.68s -> 1949.48s]  I mean, you and I talked about this during COVID
[1949.48s -> 1950.60s]  and you had to make some big
[1950.60s -> 1953.56s]  and very difficult business decisions there.
[1953.56s -> 1956.64s]  So here you are sort of creative director,
[1956.64s -> 1959.04s]  CEO, visionary.
[1959.04s -> 1961.48s]  Another thing that I just find incredible is,
[1961.48s -> 1964.80s]  I kind of think of Satisfy as the first Kiss record.
[1964.80s -> 1966.32s]  And then really I'll tell you why,
[1966.32s -> 1968.04s]  because it's incredible when you look
[1968.04s -> 1970.24s]  at the first Kiss record and then you put the needle on
[1970.24s -> 1973.56s]  because you're like, God, it's all there.
[1973.60s -> 1976.28s]  The cover, like the song,
[1976.28s -> 1978.88s]  like the songs are basically Kiss songs right away.
[1978.88s -> 1981.08s]  There's no like, I mean, the first Rush record
[1981.08s -> 1982.20s]  is not the first Rush record.
[1982.20s -> 1984.64s]  It's like, I mean, who's that drummer, right?
[1984.64s -> 1986.52s]  I mean, so like, but Satisfy,
[1986.52s -> 1988.92s]  you came out with the shirts,
[1988.92s -> 1991.88s]  with the moth eaten, the tag on the outside,
[1991.88s -> 1996.24s]  like so much of the vision was already there.
[1996.24s -> 1998.00s]  So, you know, I think that's one of the things
[1998.00s -> 1999.12s]  that is just so amazing
[1999.12s -> 2001.00s]  is that you have all those pieces.
[2001.04s -> 2005.20s]  I'm curious to hear about the practical side of it though.
[2005.20s -> 2007.92s]  Like, how do you pace the business?
[2007.92s -> 2010.20s]  How do you, I think a lot of people out there,
[2010.20s -> 2013.08s]  like, you know, they come out swinging, right?
[2013.08s -> 2016.36s]  And I'm thinking about people in the Web3 world
[2016.36s -> 2018.56s]  and they like put everything they got into it,
[2018.56s -> 2021.56s]  the very best art, the very best people around them,
[2021.56s -> 2024.00s]  they go, you know, bananas, maybe they have success,
[2024.00s -> 2025.72s]  maybe they don't, then the market changes
[2025.72s -> 2028.20s]  and it's like, shit, what do I do now?
[2028.20s -> 2029.88s]  Right, whereas I feel like you knew
[2029.88s -> 2032.00s]  you were running a marathon or an ultra marathon
[2032.00s -> 2034.96s]  from the beginning, and I'd like to give people
[2034.96s -> 2037.04s]  a sense of like, what it actually means
[2037.04s -> 2039.08s]  to build a brand over a number of years
[2039.08s -> 2041.84s]  and treat that as an ultra marathon and not a 5K.
[2041.84s -> 2044.72s]  Yeah, but you mentioned it earlier,
[2044.72s -> 2049.08s]  it's obviously work, I mean, work is like, you know,
[2049.08s -> 2053.68s]  you need to work, you need to take some risks,
[2053.68s -> 2058.68s]  you need to do some compromises
[2058.68s -> 2061.32s]  on your lifestyle, on your life, you know?
[2062.64s -> 2067.04s]  And because of this, as a brand builder,
[2067.04s -> 2070.92s]  your decisions are like life-changing
[2070.92s -> 2073.88s]  and you have to know since the beginning,
[2073.88s -> 2075.84s]  you're going to spend a lot of money,
[2075.84s -> 2079.48s]  you're going to, you need to be super confident,
[2079.48s -> 2081.88s]  like, for me, this is the most important thing,
[2081.88s -> 2085.44s]  being confident because you will also have to lead the team
[2085.44s -> 2090.12s]  and you need to have a dream,
[2090.12s -> 2091.52s]  that's super important for me.
[2091.52s -> 2093.96s]  If as a founder, you don't have a dream,
[2093.96s -> 2098.96s]  it can't work, and you need to have the audience.
[2099.48s -> 2101.72s]  Like, so many people are building brands
[2101.72s -> 2104.64s]  thinking that the audience will find them.
[2104.64s -> 2106.40s]  No, you start with the audience,
[2106.40s -> 2109.16s]  you know the audience already exists,
[2109.16s -> 2111.76s]  I'm going to make a product for them.
[2111.76s -> 2113.76s]  That's key for me.
[2113.76s -> 2115.44s]  And I have a lot of people, a lot of friends,
[2115.44s -> 2118.04s]  too, asking me some advices to,
[2118.04s -> 2120.80s]  okay, I want to make a brand, what do you think, you know?
[2120.80s -> 2123.56s]  Like, I mean, I'm always encouraging people
[2123.56s -> 2125.80s]  to build stuff, whatever it is,
[2125.80s -> 2128.16s]  but like, you need money, you need time,
[2128.16s -> 2129.92s]  you need passion, you need your dream,
[2129.92s -> 2131.24s]  you need to have the audience,
[2131.24s -> 2133.48s]  and I feel that most of the time,
[2133.48s -> 2135.88s]  people don't think about the audience
[2135.88s -> 2138.96s]  and they, because it's easy to think that,
[2138.96s -> 2141.16s]  okay, yeah, you know, internet,
[2141.16s -> 2142.08s]  yes, they will find me.
[2142.08s -> 2143.20s]  No, they won't find you.
[2143.52s -> 2144.36s]  They will build it and they will come.
[2144.36s -> 2148.00s]  Yeah, you know, it doesn't work like this.
[2148.00s -> 2153.00s]  So, I think Satisfied had a very precise audience
[2153.44s -> 2156.92s]  and also, what is important is,
[2156.92s -> 2159.80s]  your product is not meant to be for everybody
[2159.80s -> 2160.68s]  and it's fine.
[2160.68s -> 2162.84s]  You don't want to please everybody.
[2162.84s -> 2166.28s]  So, for me, building a brand is to start
[2166.28s -> 2169.48s]  very, very, very core because it's a long way
[2169.48s -> 2171.16s]  and then you will have all the time
[2171.16s -> 2174.12s]  to expand your product category,
[2174.12s -> 2177.20s]  but if you think that you're going to talk
[2177.20s -> 2181.76s]  to everybody, well, you don't get it.
[2181.76s -> 2184.48s]  So, for me, that's super important
[2184.48s -> 2188.32s]  and, of course, then you have all the pragmatic side
[2188.32s -> 2191.40s]  of things, you know, like you need a team.
[2191.40s -> 2194.56s]  For me, for Satisfied, it has been game changing
[2194.56s -> 2198.56s]  when Raphael joined me as a COO.
[2199.08s -> 2203.16s]  I'm a creative, I always say the same thing,
[2203.16s -> 2206.92s]  but I'm a great leader, I'm a terrible manager.
[2206.92s -> 2211.92s]  So, I need help and knowing your flaws is,
[2213.72s -> 2216.52s]  I know that I'm terrible at managing, I need help
[2216.52s -> 2221.52s]  and I think it's also like a quality to know
[2222.16s -> 2225.68s]  what you're good at and what you are terrible at
[2225.68s -> 2228.52s]  and I think, and I'm still learning,
[2229.52s -> 2233.84s]  and of course, I don't get it perfectly all the time,
[2233.84s -> 2236.96s]  but knowing who you are, like you need to know
[2236.96s -> 2239.24s]  exactly who you are to make sure you make
[2239.24s -> 2241.28s]  the right decisions when you build your team,
[2241.28s -> 2244.72s]  for me, it's fine, it's super, super important.
[2244.72s -> 2246.96s]  And, of course, you need the product
[2246.96s -> 2250.00s]  because the product for me is the most important things
[2250.00s -> 2253.36s]  and I always believe that maybe I'm wrong,
[2253.36s -> 2258.12s]  maybe it's a bit caricature, but as a European,
[2258.12s -> 2260.36s]  we are really good at building products,
[2260.36s -> 2263.08s]  but terrible at marketing, branding,
[2263.08s -> 2267.28s]  and I feel that in the U.S., people are amazing marketers,
[2267.28s -> 2269.04s]  but the products are so-so.
[2269.04s -> 2271.92s]  I mean, there's no luxury brand in the U.S., basically.
[2271.92s -> 2275.88s]  And, but American people are so good
[2275.88s -> 2277.80s]  at selling products, like Apple.
[2277.80s -> 2281.72s]  So, and I think I have both cultures.
[2281.72s -> 2284.52s]  I always, when I met Ian the first time,
[2284.52s -> 2287.36s]  it was, I think I told you, Ian,
[2287.36s -> 2289.48s]  I was kind of like the missing link
[2289.48s -> 2294.48s]  between the Californian culture and the French thing.
[2295.24s -> 2298.24s]  And I guess also because of how I grew up
[2298.24s -> 2301.48s]  and my background, I cannot understand
[2301.48s -> 2305.64s]  both new product and how to sell products.
[2305.64s -> 2308.32s]  When you mentioned, okay, the first Satisfied collection
[2308.32s -> 2313.32s]  was the first Kiss album cover, thank you for that.
[2313.72s -> 2318.72s]  Yes, like it's, you know, it's very hard for me
[2318.80s -> 2321.80s]  to think about my process when I create,
[2322.80s -> 2325.72s]  but it's like ACDC, you want everything.
[2325.72s -> 2327.32s]  You know, you want like, you want the riffs,
[2327.32s -> 2329.36s]  you want the imagery, you want the guitar solo,
[2329.36s -> 2331.36s]  and a brand, that's a brand, you know,
[2331.36s -> 2333.00s]  you want everything.
[2333.00s -> 2335.72s]  And if you're not ready, don't go.
[2335.72s -> 2337.60s]  Like, you know, for me, it's like you have to be ready
[2337.60s -> 2340.16s]  and you have to make sure to have everything.
[2340.16s -> 2341.60s]  And for me, it's like,
[2341.84s -> 2343.12s]  to make sure to have everything.
[2343.12s -> 2346.36s]  And for that, if you build a brand,
[2346.36s -> 2348.44s]  it's totally fine if you're not a creative director,
[2348.44s -> 2350.44s]  but you need a creative director.
[2350.44s -> 2354.16s]  Like, creativity is super important.
[2354.16s -> 2355.76s]  It's the most important thing, maybe.
[2355.76s -> 2357.48s]  You need like someone who has a vision,
[2357.48s -> 2360.36s]  who has a dream, and someone who's going to lead
[2360.36s -> 2365.36s]  the art direction and the creativity of your brand.
[2366.44s -> 2370.16s]  I feel like I have like an hour more questions for you,
[2370.16s -> 2371.40s]  but we don't have an hour.
[2372.24s -> 2373.08s]  So I'm going to choose wisely.
[2373.08s -> 2377.00s]  And then I want to throw to Zoe to ask you
[2377.00s -> 2379.44s]  about your doubling in web three as well.
[2379.44s -> 2382.84s]  But I want to recap and ask one follow-up.
[2382.84s -> 2384.00s]  So I think it's interesting
[2384.00s -> 2385.08s]  and very useful for people.
[2385.08s -> 2389.36s]  Again, I'm trying to, I think you have a lot
[2389.36s -> 2391.40s]  to share to another brand builder.
[2391.40s -> 2393.80s]  So I want to get all that out there.
[2393.80s -> 2396.28s]  I'm thinking in my head about the list of ingredients
[2396.28s -> 2397.44s]  that you just said.
[2397.44s -> 2401.16s]  I mean, I think, and the most important one is audience.
[2401.92s -> 2404.08s]  So you started by sort of seeing a gap in the market.
[2404.08s -> 2405.92s]  You knew that there were other people like you,
[2405.92s -> 2407.92s]  like me, like Scott Campbell, you know,
[2407.92s -> 2410.40s]  that we are runners, we found runners.
[2410.40s -> 2413.80s]  It's important to us, but we aren't jocks, right?
[2413.80s -> 2416.52s]  And you just saw like, that audience is there.
[2416.52s -> 2417.88s]  I know they're there.
[2417.88s -> 2420.52s]  Another great thing that I think you could put out there
[2420.52s -> 2422.68s]  is that reminder that you don't please everybody.
[2422.68s -> 2425.48s]  That's what I saw with LVMH is that they, you know,
[2425.48s -> 2427.76s]  as Jeff Jarvis said, the internet moves us
[2427.76s -> 2430.04s]  from mass markets to massive niche.
[2430.20s -> 2432.52s]  And actually, you know, niche businesses,
[2432.52s -> 2434.92s]  and I apologize, it's not a derogatory word.
[2434.92s -> 2437.00s]  I'm using it in this context, you know,
[2437.00s -> 2439.64s]  are great businesses and they can be great businesses.
[2439.64s -> 2442.20s]  The reality is Louis Vuitton is a great business
[2442.20s -> 2444.48s]  and it's also a niche business.
[2444.48s -> 2446.44s]  If you put the number of Louis Vuitton customers
[2446.44s -> 2448.68s]  on planet earth, people always like looked at me
[2448.68s -> 2450.88s]  sideways when I said Louis Vuitton is a niche business.
[2450.88s -> 2452.92s]  And I would say, take the number of customers
[2452.92s -> 2453.88s]  at Louis Vuitton in a year
[2453.88s -> 2455.52s]  and put it over 8 billion people.
[2455.52s -> 2458.36s]  It's a very, very, very small fraction, right?
[2458.88s -> 2460.28s]  It's not for everybody.
[2460.28s -> 2462.20s]  In fact, even in the world of fashion,
[2462.20s -> 2464.16s]  there are a lot of people who don't like the brand
[2464.16s -> 2465.64s]  and that is okay.
[2465.64s -> 2468.36s]  And I think that that's super important
[2468.36s -> 2470.16s]  for people to remember as well,
[2470.16s -> 2472.16s]  that you really want to appeal strongly,
[2472.16s -> 2473.84s]  as you said, be a, what did you say?
[2473.84s -> 2476.76s]  A life companion?
[2476.76s -> 2480.28s]  A life companion, you know, to your customer,
[2480.28s -> 2481.80s]  you know, not just another thing
[2481.80s -> 2484.24s]  that they like kinda, right?
[2484.24s -> 2486.60s]  But then on the practical side, you know,
[2486.60s -> 2490.56s]  sort of the work ethic, money and time.
[2490.56s -> 2491.88s]  And on some level you're saying like,
[2491.88s -> 2493.92s]  look, if you don't have all of these things,
[2493.92s -> 2496.56s]  don't start, you're not ready yet.
[2496.56s -> 2499.60s]  And I think that's, I think a lot of people
[2499.60s -> 2501.76s]  that I've spoken to need to hear that, you know?
[2501.76s -> 2504.64s]  Like, I know I've certainly done projects
[2504.64s -> 2506.00s]  that I was really excited about,
[2506.00s -> 2507.56s]  but if I'd have looked in the mirror and said,
[2507.56s -> 2510.40s]  Ian, do you have the money and time to do this?
[2510.40s -> 2512.88s]  The answer would have been no, you know,
[2512.88s -> 2514.08s]  but you're passionate about it
[2514.08s -> 2516.56s]  and, you know, you run out the front door anyway
[2517.52s -> 2518.36s]  and then, you know,
[2518.36s -> 2520.80s]  something really predictable happens, you know,
[2520.80s -> 2521.92s]  to your product.
[2521.92s -> 2523.80s]  But the one thing that I think would be helpful
[2523.80s -> 2525.24s]  for people that we didn't cover
[2525.24s -> 2527.00s]  is the storytelling side of it.
[2527.00s -> 2530.16s]  Because you talked about product as incredibly important
[2530.16s -> 2531.36s]  and obviously, you know,
[2531.36s -> 2533.64s]  you're passionate about the quality of the product
[2533.64s -> 2534.88s]  and you said earlier that, you know,
[2534.88s -> 2536.16s]  basically you'll put your product up
[2536.16s -> 2539.88s]  against anyone else's product and you think it stands up.
[2539.88s -> 2541.00s]  But now you've gotta go out there
[2541.00s -> 2543.60s]  and tell that story on the internet.
[2543.60s -> 2545.44s]  Like, how do you think about that?
[2545.88s -> 2548.28s]  And for us, it's super important
[2548.28s -> 2551.52s]  because we are a brand with a purpose,
[2551.52s -> 2554.20s]  where we create product for running.
[2554.20s -> 2557.24s]  So the storytelling, of course, is about running.
[2557.24s -> 2560.04s]  And when we develop the products,
[2560.04s -> 2561.76s]  we start with the storytelling.
[2561.76s -> 2563.40s]  We already know, like,
[2563.40s -> 2566.16s]  how the product will be used in what context.
[2566.16s -> 2569.64s]  It's basically we are designing the packing list
[2569.64s -> 2571.12s]  of your expedition.
[2571.12s -> 2573.56s]  Oh, I'm going to run the UTMB.
[2573.56s -> 2575.12s]  What do I need, you know?
[2575.76s -> 2579.48s]  The storytelling, you know this,
[2579.48s -> 2580.52s]  we already talked about it,
[2580.52s -> 2583.08s]  but I think it's a great example.
[2583.08s -> 2586.72s]  It's, and of course, sorry if I repeat myself
[2586.72s -> 2591.04s]  because I always talk about music.
[2591.04s -> 2596.04s]  But it's, you know, I think what do we do,
[2596.16s -> 2598.16s]  it's, I call it the merch.
[2598.16s -> 2600.12s]  And the experience is running.
[2600.12s -> 2602.20s]  It's like if you go to a concert,
[2602.20s -> 2604.68s]  the experience of going the band live
[2604.72s -> 2605.92s]  and then you buy a souvenir,
[2605.92s -> 2607.80s]  you buy like the merch of the band.
[2607.80s -> 2609.68s]  And I like to think satisfied like this,
[2609.68s -> 2612.00s]  like the storytelling is a running.
[2612.00s -> 2616.40s]  It's like this amazing sort of sports,
[2616.40s -> 2618.16s]  it's not an activity, it's like,
[2618.16s -> 2621.80s]  it's something else, but it's a passion.
[2621.80s -> 2626.80s]  And we're going to accompany you during your journey
[2628.64s -> 2632.52s]  with the most amazing merch you have ever seen.
[2632.52s -> 2635.56s]  And the storytelling is so important for us.
[2636.64s -> 2638.28s]  And I think what we try to build
[2638.28s -> 2639.84s]  is to build the storytelling
[2639.84s -> 2642.40s]  through the journey of our runners.
[2642.40s -> 2643.88s]  Sometimes we will have,
[2643.88s -> 2647.48s]  sometimes it will be like a collab,
[2647.48s -> 2650.96s]  but it could be also like two months ago,
[2650.96s -> 2653.28s]  one month ago, we were at this race,
[2653.28s -> 2656.56s]  amazing race called Cocodona 250.
[2656.56s -> 2660.48s]  It's a 250 miles race, super difficult.
[2660.48s -> 2665.48s]  And Satisfy had an aid station at mile 100.
[2665.52s -> 2669.52s]  And we were here to support the runners.
[2669.52s -> 2670.84s]  Like after a hundred mile,
[2670.84s -> 2672.80s]  you need like a lot of comfort, you need food.
[2672.80s -> 2675.32s]  And we were there with this amazing aid station.
[2676.52s -> 2677.96s]  Of course we have the product
[2677.96s -> 2681.72s]  and sometimes we have some events with some partners.
[2681.72s -> 2684.56s]  Like earlier you mentioned Wholesale, Ian.
[2684.56s -> 2687.64s]  Wholesale, you know, we, you know,
[2687.64s -> 2690.28s]  and for us Wholesale,
[2690.32s -> 2691.80s]  it's not really distribution.
[2691.80s -> 2695.80s]  It's more like a way to get our product physically,
[2695.80s -> 2700.80s]  but also to create a connection with like a new audience,
[2700.80s -> 2703.84s]  but also it's an opportunity for us to create event
[2704.80s -> 2706.80s]  with those like partners.
[2706.80s -> 2710.16s]  So we always before doing the product,
[2710.16s -> 2711.84s]  of course the product has a purpose,
[2711.84s -> 2715.48s]  but we know exactly where the product is gonna end
[2715.48s -> 2717.04s]  and why we are doing it.
[2717.04s -> 2720.24s]  And I think, and especially today in a world
[2720.40s -> 2722.68s]  where sustainability is like, you know, super important,
[2722.68s -> 2727.68s]  of course we need to do very directional products.
[2727.88s -> 2730.92s]  We don't want to like flood the market
[2730.92s -> 2734.32s]  with like a, you know, like a useless product.
[2734.32s -> 2736.44s]  It has to be very, very directional.
[2736.44s -> 2740.48s]  But yes, the storytelling is what leads
[2742.48s -> 2747.00s]  my designs and our creativity.
[2747.00s -> 2750.20s]  And I love to have this framework
[2750.76s -> 2753.16s]  of like the storytelling, because, you know,
[2753.16s -> 2756.24s]  as a creative, you also want to do so many things,
[2756.24s -> 2760.68s]  you know, but when you build a brand that has a purpose,
[2760.68s -> 2765.36s]  it's great to start with where the product will end
[2765.36s -> 2767.48s]  and why we are doing this product.
[2767.48s -> 2770.44s]  Yeah, it's because you have the kind of running
[2770.44s -> 2772.84s]  or you have this, or it's the race or the whatever,
[2772.84s -> 2774.60s]  that creativity loves constraints.
[2774.60s -> 2777.72s]  And you're sort of, you're giving the context upfront.
[2777.72s -> 2779.72s]  And actually it's quite,
[2779.72s -> 2782.64s]  it's almost like an advantage for a brand
[2782.64s -> 2785.24s]  that's an athletic brand over say just a fashion brand
[2785.24s -> 2787.40s]  where things are more open-ended.
[2787.40s -> 2789.00s]  Although I do think that your example
[2789.00s -> 2792.24s]  of kind of the concert and the merch table works,
[2792.24s -> 2794.08s]  you know, even if you're a Christian Dior,
[2794.08s -> 2795.48s]  because in many ways you could say
[2795.48s -> 2798.92s]  the storytelling is the main event.
[2798.92s -> 2801.28s]  And then the product is, you know,
[2801.28s -> 2803.36s]  kind of the merch that you buy
[2803.36s -> 2805.04s]  because you loved the main event.
[2805.04s -> 2807.72s]  And I think that that's a super important,
[2807.72s -> 2808.76s]  thank you for giving us that.
[2808.76s -> 2811.00s]  That's a super important way of contextualizing it
[2811.00s -> 2814.08s]  because I think that that's the problem people have.
[2814.08s -> 2815.76s]  They're like someone who doesn't understand
[2815.76s -> 2816.72s]  the luxury business says,
[2816.72s -> 2820.08s]  I don't understand how a handbag can be $3,000.
[2820.08s -> 2822.80s]  Well, it's because actually the storytelling
[2822.80s -> 2823.80s]  is the main event.
[2823.80s -> 2825.88s]  And the main event happened on the runway.
[2825.88s -> 2828.60s]  It happened in the Atelier.
[2829.44s -> 2831.28s]  It happened in the craftsmanship
[2831.28s -> 2832.60s]  and the kind of, you know,
[2832.60s -> 2835.04s]  Metier that's been passed down for, you know,
[2835.04s -> 2837.36s]  a hundred plus years that led to the product.
[2837.36s -> 2840.32s]  And now the product is just kind of an artifact
[2840.32s -> 2841.48s]  of all of that other stuff.
[2841.48s -> 2844.28s]  And I think that's very, very, very relevant
[2844.28s -> 2847.04s]  actually in the world of digital collectibles as well
[2847.04s -> 2848.20s]  because digital collectibles
[2848.20s -> 2850.76s]  are really kind of cultural artifacts.
[2850.76s -> 2851.96s]  So, you know, so it to you.
[2851.96s -> 2853.72s]  And I think like, you know,
[2853.72s -> 2856.36s]  it's super interesting to think about
[2856.36s -> 2858.56s]  all of the different ways
[2858.56s -> 2860.48s]  that you kind of have to in parallel,
[2860.48s -> 2862.04s]  like be building this brand.
[2862.04s -> 2863.52s]  Like you build it with experiences,
[2863.52s -> 2865.76s]  you build it with collaborations,
[2865.76s -> 2867.24s]  you build it with, you know,
[2868.12s -> 2870.32s]  the physical storytelling on Instagram,
[2870.32s -> 2872.32s]  you know, all of those kinds of things.
[2872.32s -> 2876.00s]  And then, you know, I think it's really interesting
[2876.00s -> 2877.52s]  to think about, you know,
[2877.52s -> 2879.80s]  the new kind of cultural tools
[2879.80s -> 2881.32s]  that are emerging in the Web3 space.
[2881.32s -> 2883.68s]  And I know that you've dabbled a little bit in that.
[2883.68s -> 2887.60s]  You Satisfy has done their own Web3 drops.
[2887.60s -> 2889.92s]  So I wondered if you could talk a little bit
[2889.92s -> 2890.80s]  about what those were.
[2890.80s -> 2893.92s]  And then just like as a brand builder,
[2893.92s -> 2896.08s]  like what did you learn from doing that?
[2896.12s -> 2897.72s]  Like, do you, where do you see that,
[2897.72s -> 2900.68s]  you know, working into your brand strategy or not?
[2900.68s -> 2904.80s]  So we, yes, indeed we did three years ago
[2905.96s -> 2908.40s]  a collab with Runners World.
[2908.40s -> 2912.64s]  We dropped some products in collaboration with them.
[2912.64s -> 2915.88s]  But aside of this Runners World drop,
[2915.88s -> 2919.36s]  we have a program called Repossessed.
[2919.36s -> 2921.56s]  And it's basically, you know,
[2921.56s -> 2926.48s]  it's basically me repurposing like vintage T-shirts.
[2926.48s -> 2931.04s]  And so, you know, we handpicked
[2931.04s -> 2936.04s]  like 20 vintage marathon, like finisher tees.
[2936.08s -> 2940.96s]  And, you know, we added some prints
[2940.96s -> 2942.12s]  and, you know, we packed them.
[2942.12s -> 2945.64s]  So every piece is unique, it's vintage,
[2945.64s -> 2946.60s]  it's repurposed.
[2946.60s -> 2951.48s]  Sometimes we change the feed, and the T-shirts
[2952.40s -> 2954.80s]  were part of the, like a bundle
[2954.80s -> 2958.44s]  with the vintage Runners World magazine.
[2959.64s -> 2964.64s]  And on top of that, we also added like a digital asset.
[2967.84s -> 2971.72s]  And what we did is,
[2974.32s -> 2977.72s]  it was like you could buy the product,
[2977.72s -> 2980.60s]  like the bundle, like bidding.
[2980.60s -> 2985.08s]  And like for me, it was so like,
[2985.08s -> 2987.72s]  everything was unique here and everything was new.
[2987.72s -> 2992.12s]  So I had no expectation, I had no clue how it would work.
[2992.12s -> 2994.32s]  And I was super curious because for me,
[2994.32s -> 2997.84s]  it's basically like, like how much are you willing?
[2997.84s -> 2999.24s]  You know, the price is always like,
[2999.24s -> 3001.88s]  how much are you willing to pay for things, you know?
[3001.88s -> 3005.12s]  And I was super curious, like,
[3005.12s -> 3007.92s]  and again, we didn't, the thing is we did bidding
[3007.92s -> 3012.08s]  because we didn't want to have like a price.
[3012.08s -> 3013.20s]  And maybe it would have been, you know,
[3013.20s -> 3014.88s]  maybe we would have sold it at 50 euros
[3014.88s -> 3016.12s]  or maybe like a thousand euros.
[3016.12s -> 3018.64s]  Like we didn't care because for us,
[3018.64s -> 3023.64s]  this experience was not about like doing like a profit.
[3025.16s -> 3026.76s]  The way we see like the NFT,
[3026.76s -> 3030.52s]  it's more like a connection with our audience again.
[3030.52s -> 3035.28s]  And it's a proof of attendance.
[3035.28s -> 3037.44s]  So if you get the T-shirts,
[3037.48s -> 3040.36s]  so there was this event, the Drop with Runners World.
[3040.36s -> 3042.96s]  If you get these T-shirts and the digital asset
[3042.96s -> 3047.24s]  and the magazine, it means that you were there
[3047.24s -> 3050.64s]  during like November, 2019, I think.
[3052.68s -> 3055.64s]  I was in front of my computer,
[3055.64s -> 3059.16s]  every T-shirt were dropping every hour, you know?
[3059.16s -> 3060.48s]  And I was there.
[3060.48s -> 3062.76s]  I was, you know, it's like the T-shirt,
[3062.76s -> 3064.68s]  like I was at the, you know?
[3064.68s -> 3069.52s]  So it's exactly the same idea, the proof of attendance.
[3069.52s -> 3072.88s]  And we had no clue and turns out that, you know,
[3072.88s -> 3075.96s]  like it worked and it helped us also
[3075.96s -> 3077.52s]  to understand better our community
[3077.52s -> 3079.80s]  because the idea of, I mean, for us,
[3079.80s -> 3084.04s]  the way we are building this connection
[3084.04s -> 3088.96s]  with our audience is what, you know,
[3088.96s -> 3091.44s]  it's like creating a fan club, basically.
[3091.84s -> 3096.84s]  And if I own like a unique, satisfied digital asset,
[3098.44s -> 3101.76s]  maybe I can have access to another level of the website
[3101.76s -> 3103.80s]  or maybe I can, you know, like,
[3103.80s -> 3107.64s]  I can participate in the design of some products,
[3107.64s -> 3110.08s]  you know, so it's like a video game
[3110.08s -> 3112.40s]  that will give me access to different levels.
[3112.40s -> 3116.00s]  And we are still exploring this, it takes time.
[3116.00s -> 3118.00s]  And again, we don't want, we are trying.
[3118.00s -> 3123.00s]  And I think everyone in this space is still trying things.
[3123.40s -> 3125.96s]  I mean, there is this amazing, you know,
[3125.96s -> 3127.76s]  like technology with the blockchain.
[3127.76s -> 3129.56s]  So what are we doing with this?
[3129.56s -> 3133.92s]  And some people, you know, take the route of like,
[3133.92s -> 3138.92s]  you know, like crypto or like NFTs or, you know.
[3139.20s -> 3144.20s]  But for us, it was really how blockchain can help us
[3144.80s -> 3147.96s]  to build like a sustainable relationship with our audience.
[3148.96s -> 3153.48s]  And it makes this life companion thing
[3153.48s -> 3157.32s]  even more like tighter, even like closer,
[3157.32s -> 3162.32s]  because now we have like an authentication
[3163.76s -> 3166.44s]  of like this connection with our audience.
[3166.44s -> 3168.52s]  So it's basically like, you know,
[3168.52s -> 3171.44s]  it's almost like a wedding ring, you know.
[3171.44s -> 3172.60s]  It's kind of beautiful.
[3172.60s -> 3177.60s]  And for us, it was a great first try
[3178.00s -> 3179.68s]  The second one was super interesting
[3179.68s -> 3182.80s]  because I think we were one of the first brands to do this.
[3182.80s -> 3186.64s]  We did an evolutionary digital asset.
[3186.64s -> 3190.52s]  So it was with a collab with this shoemaker, Norda.
[3190.52s -> 3195.04s]  And we basically, when you get the Norda,
[3195.04s -> 3199.96s]  you get also Norda trail running shoe brand.
[3199.96s -> 3202.64s]  So shoes that are meant to be, you know,
[3202.64s -> 3205.40s]  covered with mud or, you know, or snow.
[3205.40s -> 3210.40s]  And what we did is we created this digital asset
[3210.56s -> 3212.96s]  when the more you run,
[3212.96s -> 3216.16s]  the more your representation of the shoe,
[3216.16s -> 3219.36s]  which was a digital asset, was covered with mud.
[3219.36s -> 3222.32s]  And it was super interesting because then
[3222.32s -> 3226.40s]  I think we released like 50 digital assets.
[3226.40s -> 3229.72s]  And on the 50, like you had like five different stages.
[3229.72s -> 3234.56s]  And so not everybody has the same stage
[3234.56s -> 3238.76s]  of like, you know, like mud, mud covering.
[3238.76s -> 3240.84s]  And it was just a fun.
[3240.84s -> 3243.12s]  And now what are we doing with all of this?
[3243.12s -> 3244.76s]  I think it's fun.
[3244.76s -> 3246.36s]  That's a hook, you know,
[3246.36s -> 3249.56s]  but then it creates what you don't really see.
[3249.56s -> 3252.92s]  It's like the connection it creates with the audience,
[3252.92s -> 3254.96s]  which is an interesting part to me.
[3254.96s -> 3255.80s]  Amazing.
[3255.80s -> 3258.16s]  Really, really cool, really cool projects too.
[3258.16s -> 3259.56s]  Cause after the mud, you did ice, right?
[3259.56s -> 3262.32s]  Oh yeah, we did ice too, yeah.
[3262.32s -> 3263.76s]  Both directions.
[3263.76s -> 3266.08s]  And I think just for the audience who might be wondering,
[3266.08s -> 3266.92s]  how did that work?
[3266.92s -> 3268.00s]  You connected it to Strava.
[3268.00s -> 3268.84s]  Yes, yes, sorry.
[3268.84s -> 3270.84s]  And then how much you run.
[3270.84s -> 3272.44s]  And I didn't make it to the end of stage.
[3272.44s -> 3275.72s]  And both times it was like, ah, I really wanted to.
[3275.72s -> 3278.32s]  Yeah, we released them during winter, I think.
[3278.32s -> 3282.88s]  And winter is not the best time in Paris to run.
[3282.88s -> 3285.20s]  The best running time, yeah.
[3285.20s -> 3287.12s]  Well, thank you so much.
[3287.12s -> 3288.84s]  And I think we're gonna, you know,
[3288.84s -> 3290.68s]  we're coming up to the top of the hour
[3290.68s -> 3291.80s]  here we're recording.
[3292.80s -> 3296.12s]  But let's wrap it up with a couple of these questions
[3296.12s -> 3298.04s]  that we're kind of asking all of our guests
[3298.04s -> 3301.12s]  in this Ledger X FWB series.
[3301.12s -> 3305.28s]  And really we're trying to kind of convene people
[3305.28s -> 3309.44s]  that are in the space, but also just great creatives.
[3309.44s -> 3311.88s]  So thank you for the conversation
[3311.88s -> 3313.44s]  cause it's been super interesting
[3313.44s -> 3315.52s]  about brand building and everything.
[3315.52s -> 3319.88s]  So the first of the kind of the speed round questions
[3319.92s -> 3322.88s]  is what does creative custody mean to you?
[3326.08s -> 3330.44s]  Well, I would say, so, you know,
[3330.44s -> 3334.36s]  as human beings, we like to collect stuff.
[3334.36s -> 3337.08s]  You know, we like artifacts.
[3337.08s -> 3341.52s]  We like the idea of owning something
[3341.52s -> 3346.52s]  that encapsulating an idea, a moment or culture
[3348.04s -> 3349.12s]  in general.
[3349.12s -> 3354.12s]  And I think this idea, this is what makes me,
[3354.32s -> 3356.68s]  it helps express who I am.
[3356.68s -> 3359.72s]  So I would say that my identity matters.
[3359.72s -> 3362.28s]  Like it's super important.
[3362.28s -> 3365.12s]  And especially as a creative person,
[3365.12s -> 3369.28s]  I think creative custody means just value
[3369.28s -> 3372.32s]  because my idea like, you know,
[3372.32s -> 3374.28s]  are in a safe place.
[3374.28s -> 3378.84s]  And it helps me to track also how this idea may evolve.
[3378.84s -> 3381.56s]  How they may be interpreted,
[3381.56s -> 3385.52s]  how they will inspire like other people
[3385.52s -> 3387.24s]  to get like new ideas.
[3387.24s -> 3392.24s]  So I think this is what, yeah, what I would say.
[3392.44s -> 3395.44s]  And what would you, what advice would you give
[3395.44s -> 3398.88s]  to somebody who is, you know,
[3398.88s -> 3401.48s]  maybe at a traditional brand,
[3401.48s -> 3405.92s]  but they're interested in exploring, you know,
[3405.92s -> 3408.84s]  digital scarcity, blockchain, web three,
[3408.84s -> 3411.68s]  you know, you've done that as somebody, you know,
[3411.68s -> 3414.88s]  who's a brand builder, a brand owner.
[3414.88s -> 3417.52s]  And then you said, okay, I'm gonna experiment over here.
[3417.52s -> 3421.00s]  What advice would you give to someone else
[3421.00s -> 3422.52s]  on that experimentation?
[3422.52s -> 3424.16s]  I think you have to be creative.
[3424.16s -> 3429.16s]  I think creativity is everything
[3429.52s -> 3432.12s]  and need to take risk too.
[3433.04s -> 3437.68s]  Again, like we're circling back to this brand building thing,
[3437.68s -> 3441.92s]  but you know, I think as a creative,
[3441.92s -> 3443.28s]  you will find creative ways
[3443.28s -> 3446.36s]  to use this world of information.
[3449.20s -> 3453.52s]  Yes, I think, I mean, yeah, creativity is like,
[3453.52s -> 3457.40s]  for me it's like the, it's the most important thing.
[3457.40s -> 3461.12s]  And of course we have all these challenges with AI,
[3461.12s -> 3463.92s]  but I think, you know, that's also like an opportunity.
[3463.92s -> 3465.32s]  So when we were kids
[3465.32s -> 3468.00s]  and we were watching skate videos on VHS,
[3468.00s -> 3469.80s]  I don't think either of us could have imagined
[3469.80s -> 3472.44s]  that we would have the access to information and,
[3473.68s -> 3476.72s]  you know, could you imagine imagining YouTube
[3476.72s -> 3477.60s]  in those days?
[3477.60s -> 3480.36s]  Like, you know, there's no way that you could have
[3480.36s -> 3482.96s]  like dreamed that in your imagination.
[3482.96s -> 3486.60s]  What's something that you feel like, you know,
[3486.60s -> 3488.80s]  is out there in the future, you know,
[3488.80s -> 3492.68s]  for our kids or our kids' kids that, you know,
[3492.68s -> 3493.96s]  that we can't imagine today,
[3493.96s -> 3496.60s]  but it's something that you feel like is inevitable.
[3496.60s -> 3499.44s]  Yeah, that's a tough one because I mean,
[3499.44s -> 3502.24s]  I'm an optimistic person,
[3502.24s -> 3505.44s]  but like, it's very difficult.
[3505.44s -> 3508.28s]  Like, I think we, you know,
[3508.28s -> 3511.44s]  we always overestimate what technologies like,
[3511.44s -> 3513.00s]  you know, can do in five years.
[3513.00s -> 3517.60s]  And we underestimate how it would be like in, you know,
[3517.60s -> 3518.72s]  in 20 years.
[3518.72s -> 3523.72s]  So I don't know, like, I mean,
[3524.64s -> 3526.08s]  that's a bit obvious,
[3526.08s -> 3529.44s]  but like the place of AI in 20 years,
[3529.44s -> 3531.96s]  but I think there are two like scenarios maybe.
[3531.96s -> 3534.12s]  And I'm not saying that one is better
[3534.12s -> 3534.96s]  than the other one.
[3534.96s -> 3537.52s]  Like, I really, you know, like everyone else,
[3537.52s -> 3539.24s]  like I don't know because like, you know,
[3539.24s -> 3542.32s]  worst case scenario, well, it sucks because AI,
[3542.32s -> 3544.60s]  you know, wipes out the human race.
[3544.60s -> 3546.16s]  And, you know, it sucks a lot.
[3546.20s -> 3549.44s]  And the, I don't know if it's a better scenario,
[3549.44s -> 3552.80s]  but, you know, I don't know, like, you know,
[3552.80s -> 3555.16s]  AI will work like, you know, 24 hours,
[3555.16s -> 3556.60s]  seven days a week.
[3556.60s -> 3559.08s]  He's never sick, don't complain.
[3559.08s -> 3563.36s]  And, you know, and then AI take over
[3563.36s -> 3565.72s]  the manufacturing and the design
[3565.72s -> 3567.72s]  and the marketing and everything.
[3567.72s -> 3572.72s]  But also maybe it will save the energy crisis,
[3573.32s -> 3575.52s]  you know, limit the global warming.
[3576.56s -> 3580.64s]  But, like, I mean, for me,
[3580.64s -> 3583.52s]  it's difficult to imagine also,
[3585.28s -> 3587.48s]  I mean, you know, we had this,
[3587.48s -> 3589.96s]  we talk a lot about sustainability at Satisfy,
[3589.96s -> 3593.80s]  like, you know, we did this like climate,
[3593.80s -> 3596.04s]  fresh, you know, it's something very,
[3596.04s -> 3599.44s]  very important to us, especially as an outdoors brand.
[3599.44s -> 3604.44s]  And, you know, I think that like,
[3605.12s -> 3608.88s]  we love to travel, like, you know, we love to travel.
[3608.88s -> 3611.68s]  We love discovering new cultures,
[3611.68s -> 3614.00s]  we love to meet friends, you know.
[3614.00s -> 3617.04s]  And for me, it's very difficult to imagine
[3617.04s -> 3619.80s]  that maybe I will have to travel less.
[3619.80s -> 3623.88s]  And this is where it's going,
[3623.88s -> 3625.68s]  it's like, okay, in 20 years,
[3625.68s -> 3627.36s]  oh, maybe people will stay,
[3627.36s -> 3629.16s]  no, maybe we will stay in France, you know,
[3629.16s -> 3630.68s]  or in Italy, you know, but like,
[3630.68s -> 3633.60s]  we won't go to the US like we do today, you know,
[3634.12s -> 3636.80s]  I go like five, six times per year to the US.
[3636.80s -> 3639.80s]  I know that, you know, it's great personally
[3639.80s -> 3642.40s]  because, you know, I love going there.
[3642.40s -> 3646.28s]  And, but it's terrible for the planet.
[3646.28s -> 3648.48s]  So I guess for me, it's very hard to imagine
[3648.48s -> 3650.04s]  that we will change this.
[3650.04s -> 3655.04s]  So either AI helps us to resolve this crisis,
[3657.80s -> 3661.80s]  or we will definitely have to change our behavior.
[3661.80s -> 3663.72s]  And I think this is harder for me
[3663.72s -> 3665.84s]  to think about changing my behavior
[3665.84s -> 3667.88s]  than thinking that AI will be able
[3667.88s -> 3672.88s]  to fix these problems.
[3674.56s -> 3675.64s]  I agree with you.
[3675.64s -> 3678.60s]  I want to think AI might enable us
[3678.60s -> 3682.92s]  to accentuate our habits more, you know.
[3682.92s -> 3684.08s]  As Clayton Christensen said,
[3684.08s -> 3685.44s]  there are no new human problems.
[3685.44s -> 3687.96s]  We just hire new technologies to solve old problems.
[3687.96s -> 3692.96s]  But I think that you use the word need to travel to the US.
[3693.04s -> 3697.08s]  So maybe AI will allow us to travel when we want
[3697.08s -> 3701.80s]  and allow us to travel less when we, less for need.
[3701.80s -> 3704.44s]  I mean, I traveled to Asia for, you know,
[3704.44s -> 3705.92s]  two meetings last week, you know.
[3705.92s -> 3708.92s]  So maybe that's the thing
[3708.92s -> 3710.52s]  that becomes less necessary over time.
[3710.52s -> 3714.44s]  In 2010, I went for a weekend in New York
[3714.44s -> 3719.04s]  because there was this movie about the black metal scene
[3719.04s -> 3721.80s]  called Until the Light Takes Us.
[3721.80s -> 3723.72s]  And I flew just for one weekend
[3723.72s -> 3725.60s]  just to watch this black metal movie
[3725.60s -> 3728.64s]  because it was not showing in France, you know.
[3728.64s -> 3730.56s]  And when I think about it, it's terrible.
[3730.56s -> 3731.96s]  I mean, movie was great,
[3731.96s -> 3734.16s]  but what a terrible idea to,
[3734.16s -> 3736.24s]  but it was 2010, I guess it was okay.
[3736.24s -> 3737.08s]  Yeah.
[3738.60s -> 3741.44s]  It wasn't okay, we just didn't know it yet.
[3741.44s -> 3744.28s]  We didn't know, yeah, we didn't want to know.
[3744.28s -> 3746.16s]  Well, Brice, thank you so much.
[3746.16s -> 3751.16s]  I really wanted to capture this conversation for people.
[3752.60s -> 3755.20s]  I know it's one that I'll send, you know,
[3755.20s -> 3756.88s]  to people over and over
[3756.88s -> 3759.56s]  because I feel like it covers a lot of the topics
[3759.56s -> 3762.52s]  that we talk about.
[3762.52s -> 3764.08s]  And I think, you know, thank you for helping us
[3764.08s -> 3766.84s]  take that conversation to a higher level
[3766.84s -> 3768.76s]  and all that you do.
[3768.76s -> 3771.24s]  Both of you, it was great to see you, Zoe.
[3771.24s -> 3776.81s]  Yeah, great to see you too.
