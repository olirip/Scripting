[15.10s -> 18.98s]  Yeah, so today we're here with Brice from Satisfied Running,
[18.98s -> 21.06s]  just kind of getting an understanding
[21.06s -> 23.70s]  of your passion for running and how you got started.
[23.70s -> 27.66s]  Yeah, so I grew up in the mountains, in Grenoble.
[27.66s -> 29.90s]  I grew up snowboarding, skateboarding,
[29.90s -> 32.58s]  playing music in punk bands.
[32.58s -> 37.58s]  And actually I've never been interested in running
[37.86s -> 41.02s]  until my late 30s.
[41.02s -> 44.90s]  Like running for me was something very, very obscure.
[44.90s -> 47.74s]  When I grew up, I always hated sports.
[47.74s -> 51.42s]  Like, you know, I was doing like handball and baseball.
[51.42s -> 52.26s]  I mean, it was fun,
[52.26s -> 55.92s]  but like team sports were definitely not for me.
[57.06s -> 60.34s]  And that's why I got into skateboarding.
[60.34s -> 64.24s]  You know, there's no score in skateboarding.
[64.24s -> 69.24s]  And I guess I found this connection with running
[69.64s -> 72.80s]  because to me, it's just like skateboarding, you know?
[72.80s -> 75.56s]  My approach of running when I started to run
[75.56s -> 78.00s]  was not about performance.
[78.00s -> 82.00s]  It was really about being with myself,
[82.00s -> 87.00s]  like, you know, like doing this like trips,
[88.04s -> 90.28s]  kind of, you know, like meditative trips.
[90.28s -> 91.52s]  That was my approach of running.
[91.52s -> 94.56s]  I've never been interested in like competitions
[94.56s -> 96.52s]  or races and stuff like this.
[97.52s -> 102.52s]  And I started to run because my ex-girlfriend at the time,
[104.00s -> 105.28s]  she was running, I was not.
[105.28s -> 108.80s]  And, you know, I just got into running thanks to her.
[108.80s -> 113.08s]  And it was not so difficult for me to run
[113.08s -> 115.92s]  because I've always been pretty like healthy
[115.92s -> 119.72s]  and, you know, like technically it was easy.
[119.72s -> 122.90s]  The hardest part was just to find my community,
[122.90s -> 126.86s]  to find like the culture around running.
[126.86s -> 127.90s]  And I couldn't find it.
[127.90s -> 130.54s]  I couldn't understand the culture
[130.54s -> 134.72s]  because the brands or the running clubs
[134.72s -> 136.56s]  and like the people around running
[138.02s -> 141.04s]  were not really into what I call,
[141.04s -> 143.54s]  what I relate to culture.
[143.54s -> 146.06s]  It was mostly like having a good time.
[146.06s -> 147.18s]  It was more like community,
[147.18s -> 150.50s]  like having a good time together and like, you know,
[151.02s -> 154.22s]  and the brands were like promoting like, you know,
[154.22s -> 157.54s]  technicality and performance.
[157.54s -> 161.88s]  And I felt like so far from this,
[161.88s -> 164.34s]  like I couldn't really make the connection
[164.34s -> 168.42s]  between my practice of running and my experience
[168.42s -> 170.72s]  and the offer.
[170.72s -> 175.10s]  So I guess this is how I've started to think about
[175.10s -> 180.10s]  like satisfy, you know, like during one of my early run
[180.22s -> 185.22s]  in Paris, maybe it was in 2014 or something, 13 or 14.
[187.22s -> 188.74s]  So this is how I got into running.
[188.74s -> 191.58s]  It's kind of like an accident, I would say,
[192.48s -> 195.66s]  but mostly I think I just wanted to step out
[195.66s -> 197.02s]  of my comfort zone.
[197.02s -> 202.02s]  And yeah, and I don't know if like, you know,
[203.78s -> 206.38s]  running found me or I found running,
[206.42s -> 210.70s]  but it's been quite of a journey.
[210.70s -> 214.82s]  Like I was never like expected this,
[214.82s -> 216.90s]  like I would become like a runner, you know,
[216.90s -> 218.94s]  but first you are, you know, first you're a jogger,
[218.94s -> 220.38s]  you know, and now you're a runner.
[220.38s -> 222.62s]  And I will never like,
[223.62s -> 226.78s]  I will never think that I would become that guy,
[226.78s -> 227.66s]  you know.
[227.66s -> 231.58s]  Yeah, it's so interesting because I think Robbie,
[231.58s -> 234.88s]  it's interesting because we definitely have a love
[234.88s -> 237.40s]  for the culture part of running.
[237.40s -> 239.96s]  And both of us were also skateboarders
[239.96s -> 243.60s]  and we're, you know, we came into running later.
[243.60s -> 244.92s]  Like I think there's a big difference
[244.92s -> 248.28s]  between people who grew up in the system of track
[248.28s -> 252.04s]  and competition and cross country.
[252.04s -> 254.84s]  There's a different vibe that comes from them
[254.84s -> 257.42s]  than from these people, I feel like,
[257.42s -> 260.72s]  at least for ourselves, we kind of found running
[260.72s -> 263.94s]  as like a new religion and later in life.
[263.94s -> 266.70s]  And it just kind of fit.
[266.70s -> 269.66s]  And we try to bring in the things
[269.66s -> 273.06s]  that were like skateboarding and like the record store
[273.06s -> 278.06s]  or, you know, that coffee shop vibe into running.
[278.06s -> 279.70s]  So it's interesting to hear.
[279.70s -> 280.78s]  I don't think we've talked to someone
[280.78s -> 284.58s]  who's lined up as like much
[284.58s -> 287.06s]  like I was a skateboarder, snowboarder
[287.06s -> 290.50s]  and started running later and also found that,
[290.50s -> 292.10s]  you know, I'm not a run happy guy.
[292.10s -> 295.38s]  I'm not a, you know, like bright youngs.
[295.38s -> 298.86s]  Yeah, you know, the clothing, the apparel
[298.86s -> 301.86s]  doesn't speak to me the way that, you know,
[301.86s -> 305.90s]  my old pal Peralta shirts and stuff like that.
[305.90s -> 307.34s]  No, yeah, same.
[307.34s -> 311.70s]  I mean, you know, like it's such a unique moment
[311.70s -> 312.54s]  when you run.
[312.54s -> 315.62s]  It's basically the only moment during the day
[315.62s -> 318.06s]  that you're with yourself and you're alone.
[318.06s -> 320.66s]  And to me, there was no point sharing this moment
[320.66s -> 322.62s]  with 20 other people I don't know.
[323.70s -> 325.86s]  So it has never been a question
[325.86s -> 327.66s]  joining like a running club or, you know,
[327.66s -> 331.30s]  like running with like, you know, like 20 people,
[331.30s -> 332.66s]  you know, I do it sometimes, you know,
[332.66s -> 335.66s]  when we organize some runs with some friends
[337.14s -> 340.58s]  for satisfy, but like, you know,
[340.58s -> 343.26s]  I like to run sometimes with like one or two friends,
[343.26s -> 346.82s]  you know, but like most of my runs are like very,
[347.78s -> 350.26s]  like, yeah, I'm alone in my runs
[350.26s -> 354.02s]  and it's so important to me.
[354.02s -> 356.62s]  These moments are super important.
[356.62s -> 359.14s]  That's so interesting because we actually,
[359.14s -> 362.74s]  we run with the group and we run solo depending,
[362.74s -> 367.74s]  but I find there's a different kind of spirituality
[369.62s -> 370.46s]  in both.
[370.46s -> 373.54s]  So when I'm running solo, yeah, it's meditative.
[373.62s -> 378.50s]  It's, you know, time to think and like feel the run.
[378.50s -> 379.66s]  And then when I'm running with a group,
[379.66s -> 382.22s]  it's almost like I can feed off of the energy
[382.22s -> 383.50s]  of the other people around me
[383.50s -> 386.58s]  and maybe push performance a little bit if I want to.
[387.82s -> 389.86s]  So you're saying for you though,
[389.86s -> 396.21s]  this is a time that you cherish for solo activity?
[396.21s -> 399.61s]  Yes, and you know, like when I started satisfy,
[399.61s -> 403.37s]  I mean, basically all the design were like
[403.41s -> 407.49s]  coming from my solo runs, you know, like during my runs,
[407.49s -> 409.65s]  I was just thinking about the brand,
[409.65s -> 412.49s]  about like the products, about the concept,
[412.49s -> 416.13s]  about like, you know, like about everything.
[416.13s -> 419.37s]  So I built the brand while running solo.
[420.37s -> 422.57s]  Is the brand about four or five years old?
[423.77s -> 428.77s]  So we started in 2015,
[429.65s -> 433.53s]  but the first products were on the market in 2016.
[433.53s -> 434.37s]  Okay.
[434.37s -> 435.21s]  I remember.
[435.21s -> 437.57s]  So it's been six years.
[437.57s -> 442.41s]  So how did, you know, how did that idea for satisfy
[442.41s -> 444.85s]  come to fruition, not just, you know,
[444.85s -> 446.93s]  how you start to think about it,
[446.93s -> 450.73s]  but also what in your past kind of influence
[450.73s -> 453.05s]  your idea to start a fashion brand.
[453.05s -> 455.37s]  And clearly you have an understanding of fabrics
[456.09s -> 459.53s]  and materials that I would say go beyond
[459.53s -> 461.81s]  a regular like startup, like, you know,
[461.81s -> 464.81s]  when someone who wants to start a throw some logos
[464.81s -> 467.13s]  on some t-shirt blanks or something like that.
[467.13s -> 470.93s]  There's a lot of design and materials behind
[470.93s -> 472.73s]  your product that seems like it's coming
[472.73s -> 474.89s]  from a different angle.
[474.89s -> 475.73s]  Yeah.
[475.73s -> 478.01s]  So first of all, I have this expertise
[478.01s -> 480.97s]  and experience within the fashion industry
[480.97s -> 485.97s]  because for almost 20 years, I had a jeans company
[487.09s -> 491.65s]  and jeans is a very difficult product.
[492.57s -> 494.61s]  But like, this is where I mean,
[494.61s -> 497.21s]  I've learned everything with denim.
[497.21s -> 501.89s]  And this is how I've, I guess, you know,
[501.89s -> 504.37s]  like even if the product is very different,
[504.37s -> 505.77s]  the fabric is super different,
[505.77s -> 509.49s]  but when you work as a, when you work in this industry,
[509.49s -> 512.33s]  you know, you have to know about fabrics.
[512.33s -> 514.37s]  You have to know about technologies, you know?
[514.37s -> 518.73s]  And so I always been like, you know,
[518.73s -> 520.69s]  I always went to like fabric fair,
[520.69s -> 525.69s]  always met with meals, you know, suppliers.
[525.85s -> 527.33s]  So I knew what was around.
[527.33s -> 528.61s]  I was not using those fabrics,
[528.61s -> 533.17s]  but I always knew about technical fabrics.
[533.17s -> 537.69s]  Before that I had a few experiences in the,
[537.69s -> 539.93s]  like, you know, in the fashion industry,
[539.93s -> 544.13s]  but like in the apparel, let's say apparel industry,
[544.13s -> 546.21s]  because like I was, I mean,
[546.21s -> 548.65s]  I had my first brand when I was 16.
[548.65s -> 551.97s]  And it's funny because like right before our call,
[551.97s -> 554.37s]  I was in my bedroom.
[554.37s -> 557.13s]  Again, I am at my parents right now.
[557.13s -> 559.53s]  And I was in my teenager bedroom
[559.53s -> 563.65s]  and I found those like those two T-shirts
[563.65s -> 566.21s]  from my first brand when I was 16.
[566.21s -> 567.65s]  Wow, that's cool.
[568.49s -> 571.69s]  And it was like a snowboard slash skateboard brand
[571.69s -> 573.61s]  was called Biscuit.
[573.61s -> 576.85s]  And I saw those two T-shirts.
[576.85s -> 577.97s]  And then I had another brand
[577.97s -> 581.53s]  I found also like some shorts and T-shirts.
[581.53s -> 584.57s]  And the name of the brand was Pro Capitalist.
[584.57s -> 587.33s]  And it was like a punk skateboard brand.
[589.29s -> 591.01s]  And so I always been like, you know,
[591.01s -> 592.09s]  like doing stuff, you know,
[592.09s -> 596.41s]  I always been like playing music,
[596.41s -> 599.61s]  having bands, doing the merch for the band, you know.
[599.61s -> 602.69s]  So of course, you know, as you have the expertise
[602.69s -> 603.89s]  like of my like 20 years,
[603.89s -> 607.89s]  like experience with the denim brand,
[607.89s -> 609.97s]  but also I grew up like, you know,
[609.97s -> 612.37s]  again, I grew up like in the punk rock
[612.37s -> 613.25s]  and in the skateboard.
[613.25s -> 616.17s]  So it was all about like do it yourself, you know.
[616.17s -> 618.01s]  We had our own record label, you know,
[618.01s -> 619.89s]  we had our like Shitty Val,
[619.89s -> 622.09s]  we were touring, we were organizing the concerts,
[622.09s -> 624.49s]  you know, and we were like, you know, 16, 17.
[624.85s -> 627.53s]  So it helps you also to understand,
[628.57s -> 631.17s]  I mean, on top of that, you have the skateboard, you know.
[631.17s -> 634.01s]  So like coming from where I come from,
[634.01s -> 637.25s]  like it helped me to understand how, you know,
[637.25s -> 640.77s]  like how it works, like how you, how to do things,
[640.77s -> 641.61s]  you know.
[641.61s -> 643.53s]  So you make things, you want people to see your things,
[643.53s -> 646.13s]  you know, and the things have to be like always super
[646.13s -> 650.97s]  like relevant and you need like a strong message.
[650.97s -> 652.05s]  And also you need the dream,
[652.05s -> 654.21s]  you need to have to believe in what you do, you know.
[654.21s -> 656.45s]  And this is what I've always been doing, you know,
[656.45s -> 659.85s]  like, you know, when you play like in a punk band
[659.85s -> 660.69s]  or if you have like, you know,
[660.69s -> 663.77s]  when you're into the skateboard thing,
[663.77s -> 665.65s]  it's all about like authenticity, you know.
[665.65s -> 668.25s]  So first of all, everything I've been doing
[668.25s -> 673.05s]  has been led by authenticity always.
[673.05s -> 675.29s]  And then you have like the, you know,
[675.29s -> 677.33s]  the knowledge and the expertise
[677.33s -> 681.77s]  and you grow this through the years.
[681.77s -> 683.73s]  And of course, like, you know, after like, you know,
[683.73s -> 688.25s]  20 years doing jeans, I was kind of ready to start,
[688.25s -> 689.41s]  to start satisfy.
[690.53s -> 692.77s]  And again, I've never knew I would do this, you know,
[692.77s -> 694.89s]  because it's, you know, to me it's running again
[694.89s -> 697.93s]  with something very obscure.
[697.93s -> 702.53s]  But I started to do satisfy because when I was running,
[702.53s -> 703.37s]  first of all, like, you know,
[703.37s -> 706.41s]  when I started to run, I was just wearing like,
[706.41s -> 709.13s]  like a slayer, like a slayer distressed T-shirt,
[709.13s -> 712.61s]  you know, with holes and like, some like, you know,
[712.61s -> 715.41s]  whatever shorts and some Nikes.
[715.41s -> 719.81s]  And yeah, it was fine, you know, it was fine.
[719.81s -> 721.41s]  It was perfect, you know,
[721.41s -> 723.93s]  like the distressed T-shirt has holes.
[723.93s -> 728.37s]  So I had like some kind of like venting take
[728.37s -> 730.33s]  around my chest.
[730.33s -> 732.21s]  And this is where the idea come from
[732.21s -> 734.97s]  when we did this like most eaten,
[734.97s -> 737.29s]  now called most take T-shirts.
[738.29s -> 740.89s]  I mean, I always loved running in cotton.
[740.89s -> 743.17s]  So like, just, I'm saying this just to say that,
[743.17s -> 745.61s]  you know, my personal experience with running
[746.65s -> 751.65s]  really shaped the, really shaped the design of satisfy,
[752.37s -> 756.85s]  but also the ethos of satisfy.
[756.85s -> 761.21s]  And my approach of performance when I started to run,
[761.21s -> 765.09s]  like luckily I've been able to experience, you know,
[765.09s -> 767.81s]  what you call like the runner's high or the floor,
[767.81s -> 772.81s]  you know, like this moment when you feel
[772.89s -> 775.89s]  that your brain is kind of floating, you know.
[775.89s -> 780.09s]  And I guess this is why I wanted to, you know,
[780.09s -> 783.73s]  to run the day after just to experience this again.
[783.73s -> 788.73s]  And my idea making satisfy was to create clothes
[788.97s -> 791.85s]  that will help you to reach the high.
[792.77s -> 794.73s]  It means basically that you don't want to feel
[794.77s -> 797.21s]  anything on your skin when you run.
[797.21s -> 799.85s]  You don't want to be distracted by what you wear,
[799.85s -> 801.57s]  but you are, but what, sorry,
[801.57s -> 804.69s]  what with what you are wearing when you run.
[806.33s -> 810.33s]  So that was the first like, first like idea.
[810.33s -> 813.05s]  And of course, then, you know, when you're,
[813.05s -> 814.89s]  when you start to run, you carry your keys,
[814.89s -> 816.69s]  your phone and then, you know,
[816.69s -> 819.45s]  your keys start to jingle together.
[819.45s -> 821.85s]  Your phone is bouncing everywhere, you know.
[821.85s -> 826.61s]  So like all this like, all this experience
[826.61s -> 830.85s]  had to be transformed into like technology.
[830.85s -> 834.93s]  And I basically, I basically like started to think about
[834.93s -> 837.21s]  like pocketing systems and like, you know,
[837.21s -> 841.37s]  how the keys won't jingle together
[841.37s -> 843.89s]  and like where to put my phone
[844.81s -> 846.41s]  if I don't want it to bounce,
[846.41s -> 850.09s]  like how to impeach the sweat from my butt
[850.09s -> 854.45s]  to touch the screen of my phone, you know, stuff like this.
[854.45s -> 857.13s]  So like two levels, you know,
[857.13s -> 858.89s]  like you have like the first level,
[858.89s -> 861.01s]  which is okay, how to reach the high.
[861.01s -> 863.77s]  So super light products with no distraction,
[863.77s -> 866.49s]  like, you know, flat seams,
[866.49s -> 869.81s]  fabrics that feel like silk on your skin.
[869.81s -> 874.29s]  And then you have all the systems within your products
[874.29s -> 879.29s]  that will enhance this comfort when you run.
[879.29s -> 881.01s]  So these were just ideas.
[881.01s -> 884.81s]  And after like a few months,
[884.81s -> 889.53s]  I was finally ready to start the brand and to do some,
[889.53s -> 892.29s]  you know, I started with mock-up with prototypes
[892.29s -> 894.97s]  and it was very, very do-it-yourself in the beginning,
[894.97s -> 896.29s]  you know, and it's still do-it-yourself,
[896.29s -> 898.25s]  but like in the very beginning,
[898.25s -> 900.41s]  it was basically just me, you know.
[900.41s -> 903.05s]  A lot of trial and error when it comes to like
[903.05s -> 906.29s]  creating those utility parts to a garment.
[906.29s -> 907.77s]  Like, were you testing it on yourself?
[907.77s -> 909.41s]  Like, how were you determining?
[909.41s -> 910.25s]  Yeah.
[910.25s -> 911.09s]  Okay.
[911.09s -> 913.01s]  Yeah, I mean, it was just on my, I mean,
[913.01s -> 916.21s]  in the beginning, it was just me trying the stuff
[916.21s -> 917.53s]  and then some friends.
[917.53s -> 918.81s]  And later on, of course,
[918.81s -> 921.45s]  we are a bit more like organized, but yeah.
[921.45s -> 922.93s]  I mean, the brand was really about
[922.93s -> 926.37s]  my personal experience with running.
[926.37s -> 929.33s]  I was testing and I'm still testing everything.
[929.33s -> 932.01s]  So what was the, when you came,
[932.85s -> 934.73s]  when the idea for Satisfy came to you,
[934.73s -> 937.61s]  what were the holes or, you know,
[938.49s -> 940.53s]  in the market that you saw that you thought
[940.53s -> 944.13s]  needed to be filled or fixed, I guess?
[944.13s -> 947.85s]  Two things, the culture and the products.
[949.41s -> 951.05s]  If you look at the culture, again,
[951.05s -> 954.73s]  like I was not moved or touched by the existing culture.
[954.73s -> 956.37s]  Like all the products, I mean,
[956.37s -> 959.05s]  what I like to do is to add the cultural value
[959.05s -> 960.45s]  to the products.
[960.45s -> 965.45s]  And I mean, I couldn't see it.
[965.45s -> 968.57s]  Maybe some brands, they try to do it,
[968.57s -> 970.81s]  but like to me, it was not very clear
[970.81s -> 971.97s]  or I didn't get it.
[971.97s -> 972.81s]  I don't know.
[973.93s -> 976.97s]  But to me, there was no clear references
[976.97s -> 979.33s]  to any culture within the product
[979.33s -> 982.25s]  or within like the brand's DNAs.
[984.17s -> 986.49s]  And, you know, coming from skateboarding,
[986.49s -> 988.65s]  culture is the most important thing.
[989.49s -> 994.49s]  So yeah, so I don't know if I was trying
[995.25s -> 997.53s]  to filling the gap because I don't think like this.
[997.53s -> 1000.17s]  It's really, when I do something,
[1000.17s -> 1002.73s]  it's really about like what I feel
[1002.73s -> 1004.77s]  and about my experience.
[1004.77s -> 1009.61s]  So it's part of course, like filling some gaps
[1009.61s -> 1013.33s]  because if I do it, it's because like I can't find it.
[1013.33s -> 1018.33s]  But it's also, yeah, it's also, you know,
[1019.09s -> 1024.09s]  like challenging the status quo, you know,
[1024.93s -> 1028.65s]  like be like, okay, there's no reason why there is like,
[1028.65s -> 1032.33s]  you know, like 10 brands, like 10 sports brands in the world
[1032.33s -> 1034.85s]  when you have like hundreds of thousands fashion brands,
[1034.85s -> 1036.33s]  you know.
[1036.33s -> 1041.33s]  So I found the category very limited
[1042.89s -> 1044.89s]  and everybody was doing the same thing,
[1044.89s -> 1048.17s]  but overall, it's products are not sustainable.
[1049.01s -> 1050.89s]  I mean, the existing products were not sustainable
[1050.89s -> 1054.85s]  and also like the products were like super cheap,
[1054.85s -> 1057.29s]  cheap in terms of like quality.
[1057.29s -> 1058.49s]  Yeah.
[1058.49s -> 1061.61s]  And coming from where I come from, you know,
[1061.61s -> 1066.61s]  I like fabrics, I like beautiful hand fields
[1068.93s -> 1070.09s]  when it comes to fabric,
[1070.09s -> 1074.49s]  I like when products are respected.
[1074.49s -> 1079.49s]  And basically like the message from all these activewear
[1082.57s -> 1085.45s]  brands was not relevant to me.
[1085.45s -> 1089.29s]  So yeah, so that's why I started the brand.
[1089.29s -> 1094.13s]  I would have never started a brand if, you know,
[1094.13s -> 1097.53s]  the last thing you want to do is to make another
[1097.53s -> 1101.97s]  like Nike or Adidas, you know, like, you know,
[1101.97s -> 1103.01s]  there's no point, you know.
[1103.01s -> 1105.37s]  First, you can't compete with them,
[1105.37s -> 1106.57s]  but also like, you know,
[1106.57s -> 1110.29s]  there's nothing much to say actually.
[1110.29s -> 1115.29s]  So my approach was very product and culture oriented.
[1118.81s -> 1122.17s]  I'm gonna guess that you don't see anybody
[1122.17s -> 1125.25s]  that you feel is competitive to satisfy
[1125.25s -> 1126.21s]  in the running space,
[1126.21s -> 1128.33s]  just how you talk about it being unique.
[1128.33s -> 1131.17s]  So if there's not a brand that you feel like
[1131.17s -> 1133.89s]  is relevant to you in the running space,
[1133.89s -> 1138.73s]  where in fashion or where in another culture
[1138.73s -> 1140.97s]  do you find satisfy lining up with,
[1140.97s -> 1144.97s]  or do you find aspirational in your work
[1144.97s -> 1147.69s]  that you're like, okay, these people are doing it,
[1147.69s -> 1150.37s]  and I dig what's going on over there.
[1150.37s -> 1155.01s]  I'd like satisfy to be thought of in the same circle.
[1155.01s -> 1157.17s]  Yeah, so that's an interesting question.
[1157.17s -> 1160.69s]  I mean, there's a lot of like, you know,
[1161.73s -> 1163.37s]  performance brands I like, you know,
[1163.37s -> 1165.37s]  of course I like, you know, I like Arcterix,
[1165.37s -> 1168.77s]  you know, I like some products from the North face,
[1168.77s -> 1171.25s]  you know, like products are just beautiful
[1171.25s -> 1175.49s]  and, you know, fabrics are, you know,
[1175.49s -> 1178.45s]  sometimes they use like amazing fabrics and, you know,
[1178.45s -> 1180.21s]  so I really respect those brands.
[1182.73s -> 1186.41s]  But like, it's true that I find more connections
[1186.41s -> 1190.01s]  with some other brands like fashion brands
[1190.01s -> 1192.73s]  and, you know, like, I like, you know,
[1192.73s -> 1195.49s]  I like Acnesty Joe's, for example,
[1195.49s -> 1199.69s]  I really respect this brand because they have this
[1199.69s -> 1204.21s]  like discipline in terms of like product distribution,
[1204.21s -> 1207.05s]  you know, they could have been like so much bigger,
[1207.05s -> 1209.61s]  but, you know, they just continue to do what they do.
[1209.61s -> 1210.97s]  I really respect this.
[1212.65s -> 1215.57s]  And the smaller brands like our legacy,
[1215.57s -> 1217.09s]  Swedish brand as well, you know,
[1217.09s -> 1220.09s]  we have done a few collabs with them, you know,
[1220.09s -> 1221.45s]  like same vibe, you know,
[1221.45s -> 1225.57s]  these people are just like doing what they like.
[1225.57s -> 1228.97s]  It's really like a bunch of passionate people
[1228.97s -> 1233.97s]  making like super like well-made and nice products.
[1236.81s -> 1240.13s]  So I like this type of brands
[1240.13s -> 1241.97s]  when you have like a discipline
[1242.01s -> 1247.01s]  and a beautiful product with a community and a dream,
[1247.01s -> 1247.97s]  that's so important.
[1249.17s -> 1253.69s]  No, I'm not sure like the other performance brands,
[1253.69s -> 1256.73s]  the other performance brands have like a big dream,
[1256.73s -> 1259.21s]  you know, maybe selling more, you know,
[1259.21s -> 1263.65s]  something like this, but I'm not sure it's a,
[1263.65s -> 1265.81s]  I mean, it could be a dream, why not, you know?
[1265.81s -> 1270.81s]  I also see the confluence of fashion and performance
[1272.45s -> 1273.97s]  in general coming closer together.
[1273.97s -> 1276.53s]  Like what we're wearing for our casual
[1276.53s -> 1281.53s]  or what we wear around has more performance features
[1282.09s -> 1283.85s]  in it than in previous years.
[1283.85s -> 1286.09s]  But we're seeing those two things come together.
[1286.09s -> 1288.73s]  Do you feel like there is a,
[1288.73s -> 1291.21s]  like that that is a trend
[1291.21s -> 1293.17s]  that we're gonna continue to see and expand
[1293.17s -> 1297.41s]  is that it's going to become more hard to separate
[1297.41s -> 1301.57s]  like the genre of this is purely athletic
[1302.17s -> 1304.05s]  or this is purely fashion.
[1304.05s -> 1305.45s]  Obviously we see people wearing,
[1305.45s -> 1306.57s]  you mentioned like North Face,
[1306.57s -> 1308.29s]  you see people wearing technical jackets
[1308.29s -> 1309.97s]  that are meant for alpinists
[1309.97s -> 1312.09s]  that are gonna climb Everest,
[1312.09s -> 1313.77s]  but they're also wearing them in Manhattan
[1313.77s -> 1317.05s]  on the street as a symbol of fashion.
[1317.05s -> 1319.73s]  Is that something that you see just kind of continue
[1319.73s -> 1322.65s]  to grow, is that where Satisfy would have some interest
[1322.65s -> 1324.69s]  in being that kind of crossover brand?
[1324.69s -> 1326.81s]  Yes, but you know, it has always been the same,
[1326.81s -> 1329.05s]  you know, like I remember when we were skateboarding,
[1329.05s -> 1330.85s]  we were wearing like Dickie's pants
[1330.85s -> 1334.01s]  and military stuff, you know, military products,
[1334.01s -> 1335.29s]  cargo pants, you know.
[1335.29s -> 1336.53s]  So it's always been like this,
[1336.53s -> 1339.37s]  like, you know, I'm not like shocked
[1339.37s -> 1342.45s]  or, you know, I think it's no more like,
[1342.45s -> 1347.45s]  I think what is important is brands are,
[1348.53s -> 1351.33s]  I think where brands get it wrong,
[1351.33s -> 1353.89s]  it's when you have like a technical brand
[1353.89s -> 1356.93s]  that try to be a lifestyle.
[1356.93s -> 1359.37s]  And it's not the brand was going to decide
[1359.37s -> 1361.37s]  if it is lifestyle or not,
[1361.37s -> 1363.77s]  that's the people, the consumer, you know.
[1363.77s -> 1366.73s]  So every time I see like a performance brand
[1366.73s -> 1369.09s]  like posting on Instagram or whatever,
[1369.09s -> 1370.81s]  like a lifestyle picture,
[1370.81s -> 1372.25s]  I'm a bit like, okay, what are you doing?
[1372.25s -> 1374.05s]  You know, like you should keep on,
[1374.05s -> 1377.41s]  you know, promoting like your lifestyle,
[1377.41s -> 1379.85s]  which is like, you know, let's say like mountaineering
[1379.85s -> 1382.69s]  or, you know, like going out, you know, the outdoors.
[1383.65s -> 1387.21s]  And, you know, consumer are smart enough to know that,
[1387.21s -> 1389.85s]  okay, this jacket, I can also wear it, you know,
[1392.29s -> 1393.41s]  in the city, you know.
[1393.41s -> 1397.69s]  So, but it's something that I've been always,
[1397.69s -> 1400.41s]  always, I think it's cool that it's like this,
[1400.41s -> 1405.05s]  you know, I always liked this idea of like stealing
[1405.05s -> 1410.05s]  from, you know, stealing from like a utility wardrobe
[1410.81s -> 1415.81s]  and to bring it to the, to other like cultures, you know.
[1416.81s -> 1418.69s]  And we've been doing this like forever,
[1418.69s -> 1421.81s]  like the motorcycle jackets, like the bomber jacket,
[1421.81s -> 1423.69s]  the jeans, you know, everything we wear,
[1423.69s -> 1426.61s]  like all the classic products we are wearing
[1426.61s -> 1431.61s]  are not supposed to be the way we do it, you know.
[1432.49s -> 1433.65s]  Yeah, I mean, it's funny,
[1433.65s -> 1436.09s]  because a while back we had a guest on
[1436.09s -> 1438.49s]  that has worked with many, many brands
[1438.49s -> 1441.93s]  and, you know, he said now that some of the sports brands
[1441.93s -> 1445.81s]  try to make casual shoes or something.
[1445.81s -> 1448.93s]  So, and he said, nobody made casual shoes,
[1448.93s -> 1451.85s]  they made performance shoes that turned into fashion.
[1451.85s -> 1454.13s]  So the Converse was actually a basketball shoe,
[1454.13s -> 1456.85s]  the Jordans were a basketball shoe.
[1456.85s -> 1459.85s]  And, you know, these shoes that now are fashion,
[1459.85s -> 1463.13s]  they started off not with the intention to be fashion,
[1463.13s -> 1464.93s]  they just became fashion.
[1464.93s -> 1466.13s]  No, exactly.
[1466.13s -> 1469.53s]  And yeah, I mean, you know, like again,
[1470.49s -> 1472.21s]  but I guess at some point, you know,
[1472.21s -> 1474.13s]  if you like a big company,
[1474.13s -> 1476.13s]  it's very hard to stop at some point, you know.
[1476.13s -> 1476.97s]  Yeah.
[1477.89s -> 1480.45s]  So I understand why they do it.
[1480.45s -> 1484.53s]  It's just, you know, what matters is like,
[1484.53s -> 1489.53s]  it's not like, you know, it's a bit like this,
[1489.57s -> 1490.65s]  forget this song, you know,
[1490.65s -> 1492.33s]  never mind what's been selling,
[1492.33s -> 1493.93s]  it's what you're buying, you know.
[1493.97s -> 1496.49s]  So, you know.
[1496.49s -> 1498.85s]  Let's talk a little bit about,
[1498.85s -> 1501.41s]  obviously we hear the passion behind your product.
[1501.41s -> 1504.49s]  We hear the quality that you're using in the fabrics
[1504.49s -> 1507.13s]  and the thought process that you go through.
[1507.13s -> 1509.49s]  Obviously Satisfy is a premium brand.
[1509.49s -> 1513.05s]  The price is going to be, you know,
[1513.05s -> 1515.97s]  quite a bit more than some other brands.
[1515.97s -> 1520.17s]  When you, like how, when you go to market,
[1520.21s -> 1524.77s]  are you saying, okay, hey, this product,
[1524.77s -> 1528.41s]  which is normally people are used to purchase this.
[1528.41s -> 1532.93s]  How do you set the price for like some of the products?
[1532.93s -> 1537.93s]  We produce in Europe with fabrics from France,
[1538.17s -> 1541.57s]  from Switzerland, from Japan, from Italy.
[1541.57s -> 1544.89s]  And when we buy fabrics from Europe,
[1544.89s -> 1546.29s]  we produce in Europe.
[1546.29s -> 1547.97s]  When we buy fabrics from Japan,
[1547.97s -> 1552.73s]  we produce in Japan in order to be sustainable.
[1552.73s -> 1554.53s]  See, that's the one thing
[1554.53s -> 1556.49s]  that we talk to a lot of companies
[1556.49s -> 1558.37s]  and you always hear the sustainability tag
[1558.37s -> 1559.21s]  because that's hot.
[1559.21s -> 1560.89s]  You know, everybody wants to be in on it,
[1560.89s -> 1562.97s]  except some of these companies,
[1562.97s -> 1565.17s]  they're shipping across the world
[1565.17s -> 1567.61s]  all their different pieces and products
[1567.61s -> 1568.45s]  to the factories
[1568.45s -> 1571.65s]  and it defeats the entire purpose of sustainability.
[1571.65s -> 1575.29s]  Yeah, sustainability is not only about the fabrics.
[1575.29s -> 1578.73s]  That's easy to buy a recycled polyester today, you know.
[1578.73s -> 1582.81s]  Every brands have access to a recycled polyester.
[1583.73s -> 1586.81s]  What's more difficult, it's the whole supply.
[1586.81s -> 1588.85s]  It's like, where are you going to produce?
[1588.85s -> 1590.53s]  How are you going to dye the fabric?
[1590.53s -> 1593.45s]  Like overstock, you know.
[1593.45s -> 1594.89s]  Do you want to have overstock?
[1594.89s -> 1596.57s]  Do you want to put your product on sale?
[1596.57s -> 1599.97s]  Do you want to play the game of the markdown?
[1599.97s -> 1601.69s]  You know, this is not sustainable.
[1601.69s -> 1605.85s]  So the technology and the recycled fabric
[1605.85s -> 1608.01s]  or sustainable fabric, it's maybe like, you know,
[1608.01s -> 1610.61s]  it's 10% of the whole conversation, you know.
[1610.61s -> 1612.29s]  So I'd satisfy.
[1612.29s -> 1614.25s]  We have some recycled fabrics
[1614.25s -> 1618.65s]  but we also have a sustainable supply chain,
[1618.65s -> 1622.09s]  which is very important, I think.
[1622.09s -> 1625.77s]  And to second back to your question about pricing,
[1627.21s -> 1629.69s]  I think today it's just not normal actually
[1629.69s -> 1632.25s]  to buy a pair of shorts for $40.
[1632.25s -> 1634.49s]  I think it shouldn't be like this.
[1634.49s -> 1635.41s]  It's not normal.
[1635.41s -> 1640.41s]  Like $40 means that the cost of the shorts
[1640.57s -> 1644.05s]  is something like, you know, like $6.
[1644.05s -> 1645.41s]  Yeah, $6, yeah.
[1645.41s -> 1647.53s]  How is it possible, the fabrics,
[1647.53s -> 1650.33s]  the making, the shipping, like how, you know?
[1651.41s -> 1653.73s]  But of course, like people are used to this price.
[1653.73s -> 1658.73s]  So when Satisfy comes with like a $250 pair of shorts,
[1659.01s -> 1660.61s]  it's like, wow, what the fuck, you know?
[1660.61s -> 1665.37s]  But, you know, and I understand
[1665.37s -> 1667.65s]  but it's a bit like the jeans, the jeans industry,
[1667.65s -> 1670.97s]  you know, like pre-2000, you know, jeans were like,
[1670.97s -> 1675.13s]  I don't know, like $50, $60, $80 maybe.
[1675.13s -> 1680.13s]  Then 2000 to 2015, jeans were like $300.
[1681.93s -> 1685.05s]  And it's all about like explaining why.
[1685.05s -> 1690.05s]  And jeans went from, let's say $100 to $300
[1690.53s -> 1693.85s]  because we started to use fabric from Japan,
[1693.85s -> 1698.85s]  made in Japan, the washing was much more sustainable.
[1698.97s -> 1702.53s]  You know, you use less water, it's like all handmade.
[1702.53s -> 1703.69s]  So when you tell the story,
[1703.69s -> 1706.45s]  like you're not only buying like a product,
[1706.45s -> 1711.01s]  you also buy like a craftsmanship and now how.
[1711.01s -> 1715.21s]  So same with Satisfy.
[1715.21s -> 1717.37s]  We are certainly like, you know,
[1717.37s -> 1720.13s]  the most expensive running brand, but we also,
[1721.45s -> 1723.93s]  our product are also like, you know,
[1723.93s -> 1726.77s]  I'm not going to say the best because it doesn't,
[1726.77s -> 1728.89s]  you know, like every brand can say like,
[1728.89s -> 1730.49s]  you know, my product has the best.
[1730.49s -> 1734.81s]  It's not that, but like we basically allow people
[1734.81s -> 1737.41s]  to have access to some technology
[1737.45s -> 1742.45s]  that are normally used for like pro athletes,
[1743.85s -> 1746.97s]  like products that you will never see
[1746.97s -> 1747.93s]  like in a Nike store,
[1747.93s -> 1750.73s]  but you will see other Nike's athletes, for example.
[1752.49s -> 1754.13s]  So it's a change of scale.
[1754.13s -> 1759.13s]  Like we provide our community some amazing fabrics
[1762.13s -> 1766.65s]  that normally only like the pro athletes
[1767.81s -> 1770.09s]  could run with.
[1770.09s -> 1774.01s]  So that's one part of the answer.
[1774.01s -> 1776.53s]  So like the fabrics and the technology,
[1776.53s -> 1781.53s]  but also our process, we develop everything in house.
[1782.53s -> 1785.81s]  We don't work with, you know,
[1785.81s -> 1789.13s]  we don't develop products with like factories,
[1789.13s -> 1790.45s]  like most of the brands.
[1790.45s -> 1793.57s]  We don't sound like a tech sheet
[1793.57s -> 1795.65s]  or a tech pack to the factory.
[1795.81s -> 1797.45s]  We actually buy the fabric.
[1797.45s -> 1798.85s]  We buy the trims.
[1798.85s -> 1800.85s]  We have a pattern maker in house.
[1800.85s -> 1803.13s]  We have like a prototype maker in house.
[1803.13s -> 1804.65s]  We make everything in house.
[1804.65s -> 1808.93s]  We prototype the product and the product is confirmed
[1808.93s -> 1810.77s]  before we send it to the factory.
[1812.09s -> 1814.73s]  So that's a completely different approach
[1814.73s -> 1818.01s]  of making products, which is more sustainable,
[1818.01s -> 1820.61s]  but also which is more precise.
[1820.61s -> 1824.01s]  And that's why also our product are more expensive
[1824.01s -> 1827.05s]  because the development takes much more time
[1827.05s -> 1832.05s]  and it involves like many steps within the process.
[1832.25s -> 1835.45s]  Okay, so to dumb it down, like for our audience,
[1835.45s -> 1837.05s]  we're talking about limited run.
[1837.05s -> 1841.01s]  So you're not doing mass runs of clothing
[1841.01s -> 1842.65s]  that you're gonna have overstock.
[1842.65s -> 1844.01s]  So that's the first thing.
[1844.01s -> 1845.93s]  Anybody knows the less you make,
[1845.93s -> 1848.77s]  the more it costs to develop that.
[1848.77s -> 1850.97s]  Then you're saying that you're also making it
[1850.97s -> 1852.81s]  and developing it within the country
[1852.81s -> 1857.53s]  that it's the origin of the fabric is from, right?
[1857.53s -> 1859.65s]  Yes, or Europe, because for example,
[1859.65s -> 1863.13s]  we work a lot with France as fabric for fabrics,
[1863.13s -> 1864.61s]  but we produce in Portugal.
[1864.61s -> 1867.33s]  Okay, and so the people who are actually
[1867.33s -> 1868.73s]  putting it together, the craftsmen,
[1868.73s -> 1871.25s]  are being paid a higher wage than a sweatshop.
[1871.25s -> 1872.09s]  Yeah, of course.
[1872.09s -> 1874.41s]  I mean, for Portugal, like, you know.
[1874.41s -> 1876.37s]  Yeah, I mean, Portugal is like, you know,
[1876.37s -> 1879.13s]  we work with one of the best factories in the world.
[1879.13s -> 1881.05s]  This factory is based in Portugal.
[1881.05s -> 1885.37s]  And, you know, it's Europe, you know.
[1885.37s -> 1889.01s]  And lastly, the materials are higher quality
[1889.01s -> 1892.65s]  than you would typically get from,
[1892.65s -> 1896.01s]  like, you can't even get them from other places.
[1896.01s -> 1898.25s]  Yeah, like a concrete example, you know,
[1898.25s -> 1899.81s]  like one meter of fabric,
[1899.81s -> 1903.97s]  like one meter of a satisfied fabric costs 20 euros.
[1905.33s -> 1908.21s]  20 euros, and, you know,
[1908.25s -> 1912.25s]  if, I mean, if you put it in the,
[1912.25s -> 1916.01s]  if you compare with like a $40 pair of shorts, you know.
[1916.01s -> 1916.85s]  Yeah, right.
[1916.85s -> 1919.53s]  And like the, so a short is like, you know,
[1919.53s -> 1921.65s]  like 30 centimeters of fabric, you know.
[1923.05s -> 1925.29s]  You know, like, it's like, in the end,
[1925.29s -> 1926.89s]  like you have like, basically,
[1926.89s -> 1928.29s]  I don't want to break down,
[1928.29s -> 1931.21s]  like the price like this of the product,
[1931.21s -> 1936.21s]  but basically, we are actually super happy
[1938.33s -> 1943.33s]  to be able to work with like those like type of fabrics.
[1943.53s -> 1945.25s]  They are certainly super expensive,
[1945.25s -> 1947.65s]  but they are also like made
[1947.65s -> 1950.65s]  in the most sustainable way in France.
[1950.65s -> 1952.65s]  And that's a choice.
[1952.65s -> 1955.33s]  And again, I don't think the world needs another,
[1955.33s -> 1958.13s]  like, you know, Nike or Adidas.
[1958.13s -> 1960.17s]  And again, like, I'm really like,
[1960.17s -> 1961.41s]  I really respect those brands.
[1961.41s -> 1962.73s]  I really respect Nike, Adidas.
[1962.73s -> 1964.05s]  It's not about that, you know.
[1964.05s -> 1967.21s]  It's just that we don't need another one, you know.
[1967.21s -> 1971.13s]  So my point is that, you know,
[1971.13s -> 1974.21s]  we like being a niche brand.
[1974.21s -> 1976.77s]  It's very important for us.
[1976.77s -> 1977.61s]  And-
[1977.61s -> 1980.13s]  I think that's really helpful though.
[1980.13s -> 1983.21s]  Like knowing some of the things that go into it.
[1983.21s -> 1985.41s]  And like you said, you are a niche brand.
[1985.41s -> 1989.29s]  And you're also, I think for some people,
[1989.29s -> 1991.33s]  there's people that are gonna appreciate that
[1991.33s -> 1993.57s]  and be like, okay, I want these fine things.
[1993.57s -> 1996.17s]  I want something that's well thought out product.
[1996.17s -> 1998.65s]  And of course, there's people that, you know,
[2000.09s -> 2001.93s]  you will go to McDonald's for a hamburger
[2001.93s -> 2004.21s]  versus going to a restaurant.
[2004.21s -> 2006.73s]  I know you're vegan, so you won't go to either.
[2008.41s -> 2011.13s]  But you know, the quality of the,
[2011.13s -> 2013.13s]  you could take this down the line
[2013.13s -> 2016.53s]  for any product or any service.
[2016.53s -> 2019.21s]  You're gonna get what you pay for.
[2019.21s -> 2021.33s]  But you know, being able to kind of point out
[2021.33s -> 2024.93s]  those different qualities of your product,
[2025.01s -> 2026.73s]  I think will help people understand.
[2026.73s -> 2029.53s]  Because I think if you're looking at it online
[2029.53s -> 2031.25s]  and you're just seeing a picture of it,
[2031.25s -> 2035.89s]  you may not understand what separates Satisfy
[2035.89s -> 2039.61s]  from say, you know, a different brand
[2039.61s -> 2041.97s]  that's using, you know, like you said,
[2041.97s -> 2043.65s]  a factory template.
[2043.65s -> 2047.53s]  Like whatever nylon they have there at the factory
[2047.53s -> 2049.93s]  and pumping it out with the same stuff.
[2049.93s -> 2052.77s]  So I think that that helps people
[2053.21s -> 2055.05s]  and kind of gives them an idea
[2055.05s -> 2058.29s]  of why you're gonna pay a premium price
[2058.29s -> 2060.17s]  for a premium product.
[2060.17s -> 2061.09s]  No, exactly.
[2061.09s -> 2064.13s]  And the physical connection with our product
[2064.13s -> 2065.69s]  is very important for us.
[2065.69s -> 2068.29s]  This is why we, you know,
[2068.29s -> 2070.53s]  we are mostly a D2C brand,
[2070.53s -> 2074.45s]  so we mostly distribute through our own e-com.
[2074.45s -> 2076.85s]  But we are also very happy to work with partners,
[2076.85s -> 2078.81s]  you know, to work with wholesale
[2078.81s -> 2081.53s]  to make the product accessible
[2081.53s -> 2083.05s]  like you can actually, you know,
[2083.05s -> 2085.85s]  interact and touch the fabrics and see the products.
[2085.85s -> 2088.81s]  I definitely feel trying the shorts for us.
[2088.81s -> 2092.29s]  I know both Robbie and I were blown away by the shorts.
[2092.29s -> 2096.53s]  Yeah, I mean, I think it's like the Justice fabric
[2096.53s -> 2101.29s]  that you use for the shorts that feels really nice.
[2101.29s -> 2104.01s]  Like you can, I can feel the difference in the shorts.
[2104.01s -> 2107.33s]  It's hard to tell somebody that from a photograph
[2107.33s -> 2108.89s]  or another way.
[2108.89s -> 2109.89s]  Yeah, I know, yeah.
[2109.89s -> 2110.97s]  But you've...
[2110.97s -> 2111.97s]  But it's all about that.
[2111.97s -> 2114.17s]  It's all about, yeah, but as you said,
[2114.17s -> 2117.09s]  it's all about like a feeling, you know what I mean?
[2117.09s -> 2120.17s]  I mean, you know, like, if you, I mean,
[2120.17s -> 2122.73s]  if you run a lot, you know, it's,
[2122.73s -> 2125.93s]  I mean, it's, when you think about it,
[2125.93s -> 2127.53s]  you know, like, you know, if you run every day,
[2127.53s -> 2129.77s]  you know, you will wear these shorts like,
[2129.77s -> 2131.69s]  you know, every day.
[2131.69s -> 2133.61s]  It's nice to have like a nice product.
[2133.61s -> 2135.77s]  Something that you enjoy having against your skin.
[2135.77s -> 2136.61s]  Yes.
[2136.61s -> 2138.09s]  And that is the truth.
[2138.09s -> 2141.61s]  And, you know, we just received the shorts,
[2141.61s -> 2143.77s]  I guess we've had them for about two weeks now,
[2143.77s -> 2145.85s]  or so, maybe not even.
[2145.85s -> 2148.13s]  And that is a thing, like,
[2148.13s -> 2150.41s]  when I talk about the price of a product
[2150.41s -> 2152.29s]  and how it sits around,
[2152.29s -> 2154.53s]  and you talk about sustainability on this end
[2154.53s -> 2157.61s]  is where I see sustainability for runners.
[2157.61s -> 2161.05s]  Is it, like, my shorts last years.
[2161.05s -> 2163.97s]  Like, I'm not, you know, it's not like
[2163.97s -> 2167.17s]  I wear them for a season and they're gone.
[2167.97s -> 2170.01s]  I'll pull out some of my favorite shorts
[2170.01s -> 2172.29s]  that I've had for six, seven years,
[2172.29s -> 2177.94s]  or some of my favorite shorts to still run in today.
[2177.94s -> 2179.10s]  Yeah.
[2179.10s -> 2180.98s]  Yeah, and if you, I feel like if you have,
[2180.98s -> 2182.54s]  I mean, if that is a thing
[2182.54s -> 2184.50s]  where you're wearing them hundreds of times,
[2184.50s -> 2186.62s]  if you think about it per cost per use,
[2186.62s -> 2188.86s]  it's really, I mean, there's value there.
[2188.86s -> 2192.46s]  But also, if you're buying more quality goods,
[2192.46s -> 2195.62s]  then you're being more sustainable by default
[2195.62s -> 2198.54s]  because it's lasting longer than your throwaway pair
[2198.58s -> 2200.34s]  from the outlet set, you know.
[2200.34s -> 2202.46s]  And not to go on a rant here,
[2202.46s -> 2207.02s]  but the thing is, for me, I do run a lot,
[2207.02s -> 2209.94s]  and it's important to me to feel comfortable
[2209.94s -> 2212.70s]  and confident in the stuff that we put in.
[2212.70s -> 2214.42s]  And it's like the skateboard stuff.
[2214.42s -> 2217.50s]  I want to have stuff that fits the culture,
[2217.50s -> 2220.74s]  so I think that you're nailing it there.
[2220.74s -> 2221.94s]  Yes.
[2221.94s -> 2222.78s]  Oh, thank you.
[2222.78s -> 2223.94s]  No, no, exactly, you.
[2223.94s -> 2228.94s]  I mean, the product is very, very important,
[2229.82s -> 2231.86s]  but it's not only about the product.
[2231.86s -> 2235.34s]  Like, you know, I think if we buy brands
[2235.34s -> 2240.34s]  because we buy the idea of who we can be
[2242.54s -> 2245.58s]  or what we could do wearing the brand
[2245.58s -> 2248.30s]  or having a product.
[2248.30s -> 2251.18s]  So it goes beyond just a product.
[2251.18s -> 2253.70s]  Of course, the product has to be super good,
[2253.70s -> 2256.26s]  but also, if when buying a product,
[2256.26s -> 2260.30s]  you support a culture and you show also
[2260.30s -> 2263.58s]  to the people around you who you are,
[2263.58s -> 2264.58s]  what you support.
[2266.22s -> 2271.22s]  I think it's, yeah, I don't want to say
[2273.78s -> 2275.86s]  that it's like the price to pay,
[2275.86s -> 2279.14s]  but it's just a price.
[2279.14s -> 2280.66s]  I mean, your price is like,
[2282.10s -> 2283.98s]  you know, it's like, you know,
[2283.98s -> 2288.90s]  I mean, it's like, it's almost like a sensation,
[2288.90s -> 2291.14s]  you know, like, I mean, I remember when I was younger
[2291.14s -> 2295.34s]  and I didn't have money and I was like a student
[2295.34s -> 2298.18s]  and I was not really eating at lunch
[2298.18s -> 2299.46s]  to be able to buy, you know,
[2299.46s -> 2302.30s]  like some jeans or like some skateboard stuff,
[2302.30s -> 2304.38s]  you know, like, so you find, you know,
[2304.38s -> 2305.66s]  you find a solution.
[2305.66s -> 2307.34s]  And of course, it's not very healthy,
[2307.34s -> 2310.06s]  but like when you love like a culture so much,
[2310.06s -> 2313.26s]  you know, like you tend to do like crazy,
[2313.26s -> 2314.38s]  crazy things for it.
[2315.82s -> 2320.22s]  And so when people say that,
[2320.22s -> 2322.42s]  okay, the brand is super expensive and, you know,
[2322.42s -> 2327.42s]  and yeah, and I'm sorry,
[2328.22s -> 2330.58s]  but like, you know, you don't have to buy satisfy,
[2330.58s -> 2332.34s]  you know, there's plenty of other brands.
[2332.34s -> 2333.18s]  Exactly.
[2333.18s -> 2336.42s]  And maybe satisfy is not for you.
[2336.42s -> 2338.90s]  It's not for you and I'm sorry, you know,
[2338.90s -> 2341.66s]  but at the same time, what we do,
[2341.66s -> 2344.06s]  okay, shorts are 250 euros,
[2344.06s -> 2347.42s]  but like, you know, we have less expensive products
[2347.42s -> 2349.70s]  because what's this cool is when like everybody
[2349.70s -> 2351.54s]  can own a piece of satisfy.
[2351.54s -> 2354.42s]  So maybe some people couldn't get like the shorts,
[2354.42s -> 2356.14s]  you know, but you can buy like the banana
[2356.14s -> 2357.82s]  or like a t-shirt or, you know,
[2357.82s -> 2360.14s]  and be part of the culture, you know?
[2360.14s -> 2362.26s]  So it's not really about like how much you pay
[2362.26s -> 2365.38s]  your shorts or, you know, it's all about like,
[2365.42s -> 2367.26s]  but we do recommend the shorts.
[2367.26s -> 2369.10s]  Be part of the culture, understanding the culture.
[2369.10s -> 2372.78s]  But also like you don't have to be a consumer of satisfy
[2372.78s -> 2375.14s]  to understand satisfy, to love satisfy, you know?
[2375.14s -> 2376.14s]  Sure, sure.
[2376.14s -> 2379.66s]  And it could inspire somebody else to create something.
[2379.66s -> 2381.14s]  Yeah.
[2381.14s -> 2381.98s]  Yeah.
[2381.98s -> 2384.38s]  No, exactly, so yeah.
[2384.38s -> 2387.10s]  Do you remember what your first skateboard deck was?
[2387.10s -> 2390.66s]  Yes, it was, well, I'm not sure if it was
[2391.62s -> 2395.42s]  one of those first like double tail.
[2395.42s -> 2397.30s]  So it was a vision skateboard,
[2397.30s -> 2399.22s]  like, you know, like vision,
[2399.22s -> 2401.94s]  the vision skateboard like with two tail.
[2401.94s -> 2406.94s]  Right after I got the first Santa Cruz ever slick.
[2406.94s -> 2407.78s]  All right.
[2407.78s -> 2410.70s]  Remember like the ever slick with like the coating,
[2410.70s -> 2413.30s]  you know, to make like slides and stuff.
[2413.30s -> 2414.62s]  My first deck was a slick too.
[2414.62s -> 2417.62s]  My favorite one was, yeah, yeah.
[2417.66s -> 2422.66s]  My favorite one was the Dave Lee, Dave Lee burger.
[2425.58s -> 2427.54s]  It was like, yeah, it was cool.
[2427.54s -> 2430.66s]  And I, but I always been like, yeah,
[2430.66s -> 2431.78s]  I like the Dave Lee burger,
[2431.78s -> 2434.66s]  but also I was a fan of like alien workshop.
[2434.66s -> 2438.94s]  I found those like boards much more like resilient
[2438.94s -> 2441.06s]  than the other boards.
[2441.06s -> 2441.90s]  Yeah.
[2441.90s -> 2444.82s]  I think, yeah, it was a little pre some of it,
[2444.82s -> 2446.98s]  some of the workshop stuff.
[2446.98s -> 2449.94s]  That was kind of when I came in was the alien workshop era
[2449.94s -> 2452.38s]  and zero and toy machine.
[2452.38s -> 2453.22s]  Yeah.
[2454.34s -> 2455.18s]  That's great.
[2457.58s -> 2458.42s]  Yeah.
[2458.42s -> 2461.10s]  So I want to come back real quick.
[2461.10s -> 2462.62s]  The one thing that stood out to me
[2462.62s -> 2463.98s]  when you're talking about the fabrics,
[2463.98s -> 2465.50s]  that you're talking about the cotton,
[2465.50s -> 2467.82s]  you use cotton in some of your apparel,
[2467.82s -> 2471.22s]  which is interesting because you really see people
[2471.22s -> 2472.98s]  moving away from cotton.
[2472.98s -> 2473.94s]  I think it's coming back.
[2473.94s -> 2475.70s]  I think so too, which I like
[2475.74s -> 2478.30s]  because I actually defend the cotton t-shirt
[2478.30s -> 2481.70s]  as a running shirt because it's perfectly fine
[2481.70s -> 2483.86s]  for temperatures in the 50 to 75.
[2483.86s -> 2485.98s]  Like there's nothing wrong with wearing a cotton shirt.
[2485.98s -> 2487.06s]  And when it gets warmer than that,
[2487.06s -> 2487.90s]  you take your shirt off.
[2487.90s -> 2488.74s]  Exactly.
[2488.74s -> 2492.30s]  So I feel like where there's not enough of that.
[2492.30s -> 2495.82s]  And I was happy to see that you have some products
[2495.82s -> 2497.50s]  that are made of cotton.
[2497.50s -> 2498.70s]  Yeah, we support cotton.
[2498.70s -> 2499.54s]  I love cotton.
[2499.54s -> 2500.90s]  I love to run with cotton.
[2501.26s -> 2506.26s]  I like to see my sweat stains on my t-shirt after I run.
[2510.86s -> 2513.70s]  I also think it's easier to print on cotton
[2513.70s -> 2518.06s]  than it is on the technical fabrics.
[2518.06s -> 2522.34s]  Like you can do more design choices.
[2522.34s -> 2524.70s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[2524.70s -> 2529.18s]  But also, I mean, it came from my first experience
[2529.18s -> 2530.02s]  with running.
[2530.06s -> 2533.02s]  I started to run again with some bandsties and stuff.
[2533.02s -> 2538.02s]  But I wanted to bring back cotton within running
[2539.18s -> 2540.70s]  because first I like it,
[2540.70s -> 2544.42s]  but also I really think it's perfect to run
[2544.42s -> 2546.26s]  like 10K, even 20K.
[2546.26s -> 2548.46s]  I mean, I ran 30K with cotton
[2548.46s -> 2551.74s]  and I was fine, no shaving.
[2551.74s -> 2556.74s]  But the way we brought it back was with this tech
[2556.90s -> 2559.30s]  that we called Moth Tech.
[2559.30s -> 2564.30s]  So we have a bunch of Moth holes on the t-shirt.
[2566.94s -> 2568.34s]  It's like a handmade, actually.
[2568.34s -> 2569.18s]  Oh, really?
[2569.18s -> 2570.02s]  Yeah, it's a process.
[2570.02s -> 2572.46s]  So the first prototypes, I made it by hand.
[2572.46s -> 2576.78s]  So I used some kind of like a big hook,
[2576.78s -> 2579.06s]  kind of like a metal hook.
[2579.06s -> 2580.94s]  And I did it by hand basically.
[2580.94s -> 2584.34s]  And I did it on the,
[2584.34s -> 2589.10s]  I mapped the holes where body is supposed
[2589.10s -> 2592.14s]  to sweat the most when you run.
[2592.14s -> 2595.62s]  And I did it by hand and send it to the factory.
[2595.62s -> 2599.34s]  And then now they're using like a laser,
[2599.34s -> 2601.30s]  they do it with laser.
[2601.30s -> 2604.18s]  But which is funny because basically like Moth,
[2604.18s -> 2606.66s]  they'd never eat cotton.
[2608.58s -> 2610.94s]  They eat wood and silk, but not cotton.
[2610.94s -> 2615.94s]  I knew that, but it's just,
[2616.34s -> 2621.34s]  it's, you know, there was this idea of like the distressed
[2622.74s -> 2624.70s]  Moth-Eaten hole that I really liked.
[2624.70s -> 2625.70s]  Yeah.
[2625.70s -> 2626.74s]  So we kept the name.
[2628.50s -> 2631.46s]  So yeah, cotton is super fine for us actually.
[2633.30s -> 2637.70s]  And I don't know why cotton has like a bad reputation
[2637.70s -> 2639.50s]  for running, I mean, you know.
[2639.50s -> 2643.86s]  It got, it was, it was when Under Armour came out
[2643.86s -> 2646.98s]  and they were like, you need performance fabrics
[2646.98s -> 2650.22s]  for running and they did a whole campaign against cotton.
[2650.22s -> 2653.34s]  And I mean, cotton, there is a disadvantage
[2653.34s -> 2655.22s]  if you're wearing football pads
[2655.22s -> 2657.38s]  and you have a cotton t-shirt
[2657.38s -> 2660.14s]  and your sweat is weighing down the cotton shirt.
[2660.14s -> 2662.10s]  I see that there are benefits,
[2662.10s -> 2665.10s]  but for the majority for runners and stuff like that.
[2665.10s -> 2666.18s]  You're running six miles.
[2666.18s -> 2668.94s]  Yeah, it's not gonna hold you up that bad.
[2668.94s -> 2671.86s]  But like Ravi said, it's also temperature dependent.
[2672.34s -> 2675.94s]  But you also have merino too, which is my favorite fabric.
[2675.94s -> 2676.78s]  So.
[2676.78s -> 2678.58s]  Yes, yes.
[2678.58s -> 2680.10s]  Merino wool is amazing.
[2680.90s -> 2682.66s]  As you may know, merino wool is one
[2682.66s -> 2685.94s]  of the most technical fabrics and it's very natural.
[2685.94s -> 2687.50s]  And our merino wool is actually
[2687.50s -> 2689.98s]  the lightest merino wool in the world.
[2689.98s -> 2691.50s]  And it's made in Japan.
[2691.50s -> 2693.38s]  So the fabric is from Japan.
[2693.38s -> 2697.86s]  So we make the products, our cloud merino products
[2698.18s -> 2699.34s]  are made in Japan.
[2699.34s -> 2702.02s]  And they are also hand tie dye in Japan.
[2704.38s -> 2706.46s]  And yes, I really love them.
[2707.50s -> 2710.18s]  We have the short sleeves and the long sleeves.
[2710.18s -> 2713.42s]  We are working on some new merino products
[2713.42s -> 2716.86s]  for fall winter, for the next fall winter.
[2716.86s -> 2721.34s]  And we talking about natural fabrics.
[2721.34s -> 2724.50s]  We also have two other fabrics that are very interesting.
[2724.50s -> 2726.70s]  One is called dermapiece.
[2726.74s -> 2730.86s]  So it's a cotton mixed with seaweed.
[2730.86s -> 2731.70s]  And that's.
[2731.70s -> 2732.54s]  Dermapiece?
[2733.98s -> 2735.26s]  Yeah, dermapiece.
[2735.26s -> 2736.42s]  Okay, dermapiece.
[2737.34s -> 2741.46s]  Yeah, that's the name of, this is how we called it.
[2741.46s -> 2744.22s]  And basically this fabric is very nice on the skin.
[2744.22s -> 2749.22s]  So it's most like, it's mostly for like post-run usage,
[2750.90s -> 2755.90s]  but like you, the fabric is anti,
[2757.42s -> 2758.26s]  irritating.
[2758.26s -> 2759.70s]  So it's very nice on the skin.
[2759.70s -> 2763.30s]  So especially if you have run, like, you know, let's say,
[2763.30s -> 2765.62s]  you know, you like, let's say you have run like,
[2765.62s -> 2767.22s]  you know, it was hot, you know,
[2767.22s -> 2770.30s]  and you have like a, like salt on your skin,
[2770.30s -> 2772.06s]  you know, like, it's kind of like itchy
[2772.06s -> 2773.38s]  and it's not very nice.
[2773.38s -> 2778.38s]  So this, this, this fabric stands to, to calm,
[2778.78s -> 2781.42s]  to calm your skin irritation.
[2782.42s -> 2784.50s]  So that's a fabric we are,
[2784.54s -> 2786.86s]  we have launched it a year ago
[2786.86s -> 2791.42s]  and there is more coming for the month of May this year.
[2791.42s -> 2793.62s]  And another fabric that we're launching
[2793.62s -> 2797.66s]  at the same time in May is a nylon made from plants.
[2797.66s -> 2802.66s]  So nylon is normally made from plastic, petrol,
[2802.94s -> 2805.34s]  you know, it's polyamide, you know,
[2805.34s -> 2808.66s]  but this nylon is made from like castor oil.
[2808.66s -> 2812.38s]  So it has a part of it is very sustainable.
[2812.38s -> 2815.74s]  Of course, the process is still like polymerization.
[2815.74s -> 2819.62s]  So it's like, you know, it's, it's, it's chemical,
[2819.62s -> 2823.22s]  but the, the, the source is vegetal.
[2823.22s -> 2824.38s]  Cool.
[2824.38s -> 2825.90s]  So that's very interesting as well.
[2825.90s -> 2827.26s]  So as much as we can,
[2827.26s -> 2829.82s]  we are really pushing for like natural fabrics.
[2829.82s -> 2831.38s]  Yeah.
[2831.38s -> 2833.06s]  And natural technologies, yeah.
[2833.06s -> 2834.82s]  That's really cool.
[2834.82s -> 2836.58s]  So what's your, what's your favorite piece
[2836.58s -> 2838.98s]  of Satisfy apparel?
[2839.98s -> 2843.54s]  So I guess, I mean, I always run with the most,
[2843.54s -> 2847.70s]  the most like muscle tee, the long sleeve Merino
[2847.70s -> 2851.78s]  and the 2.5 or the three trail shorts.
[2851.78s -> 2852.62s]  Gotcha.
[2852.62s -> 2855.30s]  I wear the tie dye socks
[2856.38s -> 2859.62s]  and I always wear a bandana.
[2859.62s -> 2860.46s]  Nice.
[2860.46s -> 2862.26s]  And yeah, that's it.
[2862.26s -> 2863.10s]  Cool.
[2863.10s -> 2864.10s]  Yeah. And it's not the,
[2864.10s -> 2866.26s]  not always the Polartek one though, right?
[2867.26s -> 2869.34s]  I love the Polartek.
[2870.46s -> 2873.34s]  I use the Polartek when it's very, very cold.
[2873.34s -> 2874.18s]  Yeah.
[2874.18s -> 2876.30s]  I use the Polartek.
[2877.26s -> 2879.98s]  It's funny because I stopped wearing jacket when I run.
[2879.98s -> 2881.58s]  I don't like jacket when I run.
[2882.98s -> 2885.74s]  I'm too hot when I, when I run with,
[2885.74s -> 2887.66s]  or it's too warm when I run with jacket.
[2887.66s -> 2891.62s]  So now I just layer the long sleeve Merino
[2891.62s -> 2895.86s]  and the Polartek and I'm good.
[2895.86s -> 2899.02s]  Even when it's like minus five degrees Celsius.
[2899.02s -> 2902.46s]  I don't know how you, how it's,
[2902.46s -> 2905.42s]  how it is in Fahrenheit, but it's pretty cold.
[2905.42s -> 2906.26s]  Yeah.
[2906.26s -> 2907.58s]  Same for shorts.
[2907.58s -> 2909.54s]  Like when it's very cold, like I wear shorts.
[2909.54s -> 2911.66s]  I don't like tights and you know, I mean,
[2911.66s -> 2912.54s]  I like to wear shorts.
[2912.54s -> 2915.06s]  I mean, you never really cold with on your legs,
[2915.06s -> 2917.14s]  you know, unless like, of course,
[2917.14s -> 2918.90s]  if you run in the snow and you know,
[2918.90s -> 2921.02s]  but like it's pretty rare for me
[2921.02s -> 2923.26s]  to run in the snow, unfortunately.
[2923.30s -> 2926.74s]  And if anyone's wondering if the gear holds up
[2926.74s -> 2929.74s]  to the longer distances, it was cool.
[2929.74s -> 2934.18s]  Last year, one of your athletes, Michael Versteg,
[2934.18s -> 2939.18s]  won the Cocodono race, what, 240?
[2939.18s -> 2940.70s]  I thought it was 231 or something.
[2940.70s -> 2941.54s]  250, yeah.
[2941.54s -> 2942.54s]  It's a lot of miles.
[2942.54s -> 2944.26s]  It's more than 200 miles.
[2944.26s -> 2945.42s]  Across Arizona.
[2945.42s -> 2946.74s]  I thought that was pretty cool to see.
[2946.74s -> 2949.22s]  Yeah, and yeah, I mean, our products,
[2949.22s -> 2951.90s]  I mean, yeah, I mean,
[2951.90s -> 2954.14s]  we didn't win because of our products, obviously,
[2954.14s -> 2958.42s]  but I mean, he's a great athlete.
[2958.42s -> 2961.46s]  I'm super happy to, he's a great athlete
[2961.46s -> 2962.70s]  and a great person.
[2962.70s -> 2965.66s]  I'm super happy to collaborate with him, yeah.
[2965.66s -> 2966.50s]  Awesome.
[2966.50s -> 2969.54s]  I'm gonna ask you for a product that you don't make,
[2969.54s -> 2970.90s]  which is running shoes.
[2970.90s -> 2974.74s]  What's your favorite daily trainer or race shoe?
[2974.74s -> 2977.94s]  At the moment, I run a lot with my Nordas.
[2977.94s -> 2979.14s]  I love Norda shoes.
[2979.14s -> 2979.98s]  Oh yeah.
[2979.98s -> 2984.98s]  I use them for both trail and road.
[2987.90s -> 2989.46s]  I also like Hoka.
[2989.46s -> 2990.30s]  Cool.
[2990.30s -> 2993.62s]  Yeah, the Norda was surprisingly,
[2993.62s -> 2996.30s]  it's probably my favorite road to trail shoe.
[2996.30s -> 2999.14s]  Like it's just great for any situation, really.
[2999.14s -> 2999.98s]  They did a really nice job.
[2999.98s -> 3001.82s]  Yeah, no, it's, yes.
[3001.82s -> 3005.70s]  If I have to bring just one pair of running shoes,
[3005.70s -> 3006.86s]  which I did actually,
[3009.14s -> 3011.14s]  again, I'm at my parents right now
[3011.14s -> 3013.54s]  and I arrived earlier today
[3013.54s -> 3014.82s]  and I just brought my Nordas
[3014.82s -> 3018.22s]  and this week I will do like trail and road
[3018.22s -> 3019.66s]  and these are perfect.
[3019.66s -> 3020.50s]  Nice. Awesome.
[3021.42s -> 3022.26s]  Cool.
[3024.22s -> 3025.38s]  I have one last question.
[3025.38s -> 3026.22s]  Hit it.
[3026.22s -> 3029.90s]  What's your favorite band running shirt?
[3029.90s -> 3033.06s]  Do you still run in your band shirts as well?
[3033.06s -> 3034.26s]  Yeah, I still do it.
[3034.26s -> 3036.14s]  I still run with my band tees.
[3036.14s -> 3038.58s]  And it's a hard question.
[3042.94s -> 3044.30s]  At some point I was running a lot
[3044.30s -> 3046.42s]  with my Dark Throne t-shirt.
[3046.42s -> 3047.26s]  Okay.
[3047.26s -> 3048.82s]  It's a black metal band from Norway.
[3050.86s -> 3053.18s]  Also I run with,
[3053.18s -> 3054.50s]  I'm trying to think like which one,
[3054.50s -> 3056.86s]  because I crop sleeves.
[3056.86s -> 3058.22s]  I don't like t-shirts.
[3058.22s -> 3060.42s]  I run with long sleeves or crop sleeves.
[3060.42s -> 3061.26s]  Gotcha.
[3061.26s -> 3062.10s]  I don't see the point of,
[3062.10s -> 3063.82s]  I don't understand short sleeves t-shirt.
[3064.70s -> 3066.90s]  Most people do,
[3066.90s -> 3067.82s]  but I don't understand.
[3067.82s -> 3070.02s]  I mean, it's hard to get no sleeves.
[3070.02s -> 3070.94s]  It's called long sleeves.
[3070.94s -> 3073.58s]  I don't understand the short sleeves.
[3073.58s -> 3074.62s]  No in between for you.
[3074.62s -> 3075.98s]  That's a good point.
[3075.98s -> 3080.50s]  But 99% of the population must think the opposite.
[3080.50s -> 3083.58s]  So I must be a weirdo.
[3083.58s -> 3085.54s]  But yeah, I like my Dark Throne t-shirt
[3085.54s -> 3087.94s]  and what else?
[3087.94s -> 3090.30s]  Yeah, always some like Metallica t-shirts.
[3092.02s -> 3093.38s]  I mean, mostly like heavy metal
[3093.90s -> 3096.70s]  because I love heavy metal and punk and stuff like this.
[3098.22s -> 3099.58s]  But like when I started to run,
[3099.58s -> 3101.62s]  I was running with my Slayer t-shirt.
[3101.62s -> 3102.46s]  Okay, cool.
[3102.46s -> 3103.90s]  Which would be Ober's favorite.
[3103.90s -> 3106.82s]  Yeah, we have a friend who often runs
[3106.82s -> 3108.50s]  in his Slayer t-shirt.
[3108.50s -> 3109.34s]  Yeah.
[3110.58s -> 3112.10s]  That's great.
[3112.10s -> 3115.02s]  Well, Brice, thank you so much for coming on.
[3115.02s -> 3116.82s]  It was a really cool conversation.
[3118.22s -> 3119.10s]  Thank you for having me.
[3119.10s -> 3122.10s]  It was really great to speak to you guys.
[3122.26s -> 3124.58s]  And we are genuinely really enjoying the product.
[3124.58s -> 3127.62s]  So we are known, you probably don't know this,
[3127.62s -> 3130.46s]  but we are pretty much known for calling bullshit
[3130.46s -> 3131.70s]  when there's bullshit.
[3131.70s -> 3136.70s]  And this product, I really like the shorts quite a bit.
[3137.90s -> 3140.30s]  I know Robbie and I have talked back and forth about it.
[3140.30s -> 3142.06s]  I just wore them last night on the trails actually.
[3142.06s -> 3144.26s]  I wore them last night in the group run.
[3144.26s -> 3147.82s]  So yeah, and my wife said to me today
[3147.82s -> 3149.70s]  because I threw some stuff in the wash,
[3149.70s -> 3151.62s]  she says, is there anything that can't go in the dryer?
[3152.14s -> 3155.14s]  And I said, make sure that the shorts go on the hanging rack.
[3156.70s -> 3158.58s]  Yeah, thank you, it means a lot.
[3158.58s -> 3159.58s]  Thank you so much.
[3161.46s -> 3162.30s]  Yeah.
[3162.30s -> 3163.14s]  All right.
