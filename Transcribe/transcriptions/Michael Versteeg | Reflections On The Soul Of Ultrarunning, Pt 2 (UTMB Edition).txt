[0.46s -> 7.66s]  Station ID. So we're here. This is yet another conversation celebrating the week of the Ultra
[7.66s -> 13.10s]  Child du Mont Blanc. We're here in our, I guess this is like northern Chamonix proper studios.
[14.14s -> 17.58s]  Quick thanks to our partners, NAC, Nordagora, Raid for keeping the lights on here,
[17.58s -> 20.06s]  making this possible. Go check all them out in the show notes.
[21.10s -> 27.66s]  And I'd like to think of this as sort of a part two to a conversation that we had
[28.38s -> 34.46s]  about a year ago post 2024 Cocodonan. I'm joined by Michael Versteve for it. Michael,
[34.46s -> 39.42s]  how's it going today? I'm a little sleepy, but how are you? You just get in? No,
[39.42s -> 43.10s]  I've been here for a long time. Well, I've been in Europe for a long time, but I just...
[45.18s -> 53.02s]  Like all summer? No, like a week. Okay. Yeah. Not a long time. A middle amount of time.
[53.82s -> 61.18s]  I just think as I get older, I have a hard time sleeping in strange,
[63.10s -> 69.18s]  frilly places. Yeah. Chalets and Chamonix are not my like normal sleeping arrangements.
[70.46s -> 75.10s]  I want to come back to Wallace Stegner. I don't even know if we got it on recording
[75.82s -> 79.98s]  or the influencer thing, but we'll come back to it. You were here in 2015. You did this
[79.98s -> 84.94s]  whole bike packing thing. You made a whole summer of Europe out here and you were in
[84.94s -> 90.94s]  the Western Pyrenees for a bit. You did a hundred mile over there. Yeah. I feel like at some
[90.94s -> 96.54s]  point in life, years start to combine and it's hard to pinpoint, but are there any
[96.54s -> 100.94s]  takeaways from that year and that time spent out here? Oh, for sure. Yeah. I mean,
[102.94s -> 108.22s]  I spend a lot of time in Northern Spain in general. I have a close friend and his whole
[108.22s -> 114.06s]  family we're like close with. And I built a house on their property, I don't know,
[114.06s -> 122.70s]  like five or six years ago, but I actually met him and them on that trip. So that's been like
[122.70s -> 127.42s]  some lifelong friends that I made that still that's actually who's like van I drove here
[127.42s -> 134.38s]  in is like their van. So I spent quite a bit of time in the Pyrenees and Catalonia because
[134.38s -> 143.26s]  of them. But yeah, that was a lot. It was just like, it was my first time racing in Europe and
[144.14s -> 150.78s]  it wasn't really a planned bicycle trip. I sort of got, I landed in Paris and I remember
[150.78s -> 154.62s]  going to the train station and just getting really pissed off about how expensive train
[154.62s -> 163.26s]  tickets were. So I just went and bought like a shitty bicycle and like some like straps
[164.22s -> 168.86s]  you know, strapped things on just took off from there. But it was a long summer, you know,
[168.86s -> 174.62s]  like riding, you know, riding your bicycle through the Pyrenees to get to races is like
[174.62s -> 183.18s]  not the probably most ideal like taper of like for athletic performance. But it was fine. We
[183.18s -> 189.18s]  spent and then we ended up spending quite a bit of time in Chamonix. I was with some
[189.18s -> 195.34s]  friends we were climbing on that trip. So we spent a few weeks here in Chamonix before the race
[195.34s -> 202.78s]  climbing like all around the massive. Which I think that kind of contributed to me being
[202.78s -> 209.66s]  like pretty burnt out on the area and the race and just not the only reason why I dropped,
[209.66s -> 218.22s]  but I didn't really have the motivation to keep going, I guess. Yeah, it was a good fun,
[218.22s -> 223.34s]  young guy in his 20s. Like summer on a bike. Yeah.
[224.78s -> 228.62s]  So that trip was so formative that you came back and built a house out here?
[230.62s -> 236.62s]  Well, I would say the relationship that I created with a family in Spain. Yeah. And
[236.62s -> 242.14s]  like they come to their climbers and they're like, you know, they're my age. And I mean,
[242.14s -> 246.38s]  that guy, that guy, particularly Nikki, who I'm very close with, like he's lived in like
[246.38s -> 250.30s]  he's come to the U.S. He works saddles every year. He's lived in my cabin for like
[251.58s -> 256.46s]  years. Like he comes to the U.S. a lot. We go climbing. We've been climbing, like we've
[256.46s -> 261.50s]  gone climbing in Patagonia and like Cochimo Valley and we've been all over the world
[261.50s -> 266.70s]  together. So he's become a close friend. He's friends with my wife and my baby.
[269.34s -> 275.74s]  I think maybe I haven't like probed deep enough into other people, but it's not quite
[275.74s -> 279.66s]  on the surface how multifaceted they are or how good they are at multiple things. And like
[280.54s -> 283.90s]  with you, I mean, carpentry is just one of the things. Where did you pick up carpentry?
[285.42s -> 289.74s]  I think I'm just like cheap. Or maybe I'm just like poor. I've been poor my whole life,
[289.74s -> 292.06s]  I guess. So it's like, I feel like when you're poor, are you just like,
[293.74s -> 300.78s]  I'm stubborn and idealistic, I guess. It's like, I just like can't stand getting like
[300.86s -> 305.82s]  scammed. I feel like everything's a scam. So I just have to do everything myself.
[306.86s -> 310.86s]  So it's like, it's just like years of like building shitty cabins and like learning it
[310.86s -> 314.54s]  and figure it out. I mean, everything seems difficult until you know how to do it,
[314.54s -> 318.06s]  right? Like I couldn't set up this microphone if you asked me to.
[318.06s -> 318.78s]  I can't either.
[318.78s -> 322.14s]  But it's like, but it's actually like not that hard if you know how to do it, right?
[322.14s -> 327.10s]  Or I don't know. It's like, stuff's like not that hard when like changing a
[328.06s -> 332.14s]  water pump on a car is like really difficult if you have no idea how to do it.
[332.86s -> 336.46s]  But if you know how to do it, it's not a big deal. So it's just like climbing that
[336.46s -> 340.86s]  and not to like talk shit about like, well, this is very clearly talking shit about
[340.86s -> 345.26s]  construction workers. But generally speaking, like construction workers are like not
[346.06s -> 349.26s]  the most intelligent group of people that I've ever met in my life,
[349.26s -> 353.90s]  for like thoughtful or philosophical. So it's like, at least in my town,
[353.90s -> 364.21s]  they're all like fucking pieces of shit. So, but no, I mean, you guys know, I'm joking,
[364.21s -> 368.29s]  but I'm like, you guys know what I'm saying. It's like, construction's not like this like
[368.29s -> 373.65s]  intellectual. It can be, it can't, and there are certainly like, I actually think that's
[373.65s -> 377.09s]  one thing that's really interesting about construction. Because at the way that like
[377.09s -> 382.93s]  99% of people do construction fucking sucks. But the 1% of it that like treat it like art
[382.93s -> 387.81s]  or treat it like something expressive and something interesting. And like,
[387.81s -> 391.57s]  like architecture, I think is really interesting. You know what I mean? Like people who
[391.57s -> 397.25s]  look at building a house in that manner, not just like this like capitalistic churning of
[397.25s -> 402.93s]  track homes, you know, it's like, like development, you know, but look at it like,
[402.93s -> 406.13s]  like, so that's what I mean. It's like, it's maybe that's true of everything,
[406.13s -> 410.13s]  that there's like 90% of people that do it just for like, whatever reasons,
[410.13s -> 414.29s]  but there's like a small percentage of people who excel at things and do things thoughtfully,
[414.93s -> 420.13s]  which is like really good. Like 90% of podcasts fucking suck. But here I am sitting here,
[420.13s -> 426.85s]  talking to you, because there's like, thoughtful things that happen in conversations that can
[426.85s -> 432.37s]  happen. Even though like most podcasts are about like, reality television or something.
[432.37s -> 434.37s]  I don't know. I don't know what podcasts are about.
[435.57s -> 439.25s]  I think I think again, I want to keep going on carpentry. But I think the reason I ask
[439.25s -> 442.85s]  it is if I look at everything you've done in your life and running is almost like
[443.49s -> 449.33s]  a side piece to it all. It seems like you're super good at tolerating the learning curve
[449.33s -> 454.05s]  in something. Yeah, I mean, I think that's important. I think that I mean, I probably
[454.05s -> 459.97s]  spent my 20s and most of my 30s doing things poorly. You know, and I mean,
[459.97s -> 466.29s]  maybe I still am actually, but it's like you, you can't be like good at everything
[467.25s -> 470.53s]  right away. It's like you just have to throw yourself into it. And it's like,
[470.53s -> 474.77s]  it's like skiing or something. You don't learn skiing by like taking lessons and pizza down
[474.77s -> 478.37s]  a hill. Like you go up to the top of the mountain and you fucking go for it. You know,
[478.37s -> 482.61s]  it's like that's how you learn how to ski. It's like everything you learn by doing.
[482.61s -> 486.69s]  And so it's just like, if you're okay with that, if you're like, I don't know if like
[486.69s -> 492.21s]  humble is the right word, but if you're like humble enough to like, put yourself in situations
[492.21s -> 498.13s]  that like, you're not not good at it, you know, it's like, then you it's a lot easier
[498.13s -> 503.41s]  to learn how to do things. Asking for help and like asking for teachers, you know,
[503.41s -> 509.01s]  except that, I mean, that's life, I guess. How many cabins did you have to make until
[509.01s -> 513.57s]  you got to? Not that many. Like I said, it's not that hard. Like, yeah, like, like,
[513.57s -> 518.37s]  I mean, I don't build like, you know, I mean, I could probably build this, but
[519.33s -> 526.18s]  it's like, I build pretty like simple stuff, you know? I mean, I think it's nice. I think
[526.18s -> 531.14s]  it's like aesthetically pleasing to me. And it's all the things that I alluded to
[531.14s -> 534.82s]  about like, I put a lot of thought and like intention into things and
[536.02s -> 542.46s]  aesthetics and functionality and all that stuff. But I don't know.
[543.42s -> 548.78s]  I have a huge bone to pick with architecture. Sure. I live in Utah. I know you're in
[548.78s -> 554.86s]  Arizona. And it's see a sameness and just the like, entire neighborhoods are just
[554.86s -> 559.42s]  reproduced off of just like some derivative version of a house. Yeah. And they're not
[559.42s -> 564.78s]  built. They're not built to last. And that's how I get to that. Now that you know,
[564.78s -> 569.66s]  this whole space, how did it get to that? I mean, I hate to be this fucking guy,
[569.66s -> 575.26s]  but I am this capitalism, you know, it's like, it's the great destroyer of all things
[575.26s -> 579.74s]  good and creative in the world. And it's like, you churn out as many units as you
[579.74s -> 584.86s]  possibly can as cheaply as you can. I mean, it's like, and that's fine. I mean,
[584.86s -> 589.26s]  most people and that's actually like, it's fine. It's like, it's not a big deal. Like 90,
[589.26s -> 593.58s]  again, like most people don't give a shit where they live or like their house.
[593.58s -> 599.98s]  It's just like, or they do, but like, I don't, I don't know. It's like,
[599.98s -> 608.14s]  like, like, I think, I think development and architecture and how homes fit the culture,
[609.02s -> 615.10s]  you know, and in a lot of ways, I think American culture sucks too. I think it's like bland and
[615.10s -> 622.78s]  washed out and like, you know, I just like, I just think that like most people don't like
[623.34s -> 630.94s]  or they don't, they don't prioritize and that's not good or bad. It's like, whatever. I know I'm
[630.94s -> 634.22s]  being critical of it because I mean, that's what I do. Right. That's why you invite me on the
[634.22s -> 641.74s]  show is to talk shit about me, but no, no, I'm just kidding. It's like, I just,
[643.50s -> 652.26s]  like most of my family, like most of, they like those kinds of homes. There's nothing
[652.26s -> 655.86s]  wrong with that. They like living in like a neighborhood where every house looks the same
[655.86s -> 663.10s]  and everything. When you were building the place outside of Prescott, what were some of the
[663.82s -> 668.54s]  stylistic considerations? Like, what did you want to exist there?
[673.68s -> 681.30s]  I think I'm big, like, again, it's just like personal aesthetics, right? I mean,
[681.30s -> 685.54s]  other than like functionality and like building a place well, which like that's
[685.54s -> 688.82s]  also what those other houses aren't. They're not necessarily built super well,
[689.62s -> 693.14s]  but building a place super well and building a place that like fits the environment,
[693.14s -> 698.74s]  both aesthetically and like functionally. So it's like utilizing, it's like very simple thing.
[698.74s -> 705.06s]  It's like, which way does the house face? You know what I mean? It's like the smallest
[705.06s -> 709.94s]  thing in the world. Do you have a south facing home or north? It's like, you know,
[709.94s -> 714.74s]  and it's like things that just aren't considered in like developments. You know what I mean? But
[714.74s -> 719.70s]  when you build a singular house, especially for yourself, like certain things matter.
[719.70s -> 723.70s]  So you like consider these things about like where you're getting water from,
[723.70s -> 729.06s]  like consumption, like, and for me, I mean, because I'm the one like constantly
[729.06s -> 734.58s]  maintaining and repairing things. It's like simplicity and like ease of repair.
[734.58s -> 737.86s]  Things need to get repaired. You know what I mean? You're not like having to
[738.82s -> 743.22s]  tear the house apart if you have a leak or something. You know, it's like,
[744.98s -> 749.70s]  so it's just all those considerations, but also like the materials. I mean, it's the same thing.
[749.70s -> 753.70s]  It's the same thing as like, I know, I know Satisfye gets a bad rap for things, but it's
[753.70s -> 758.34s]  like, it's the same thing when like Reese is considering like where his materials come from
[758.34s -> 761.30s]  and how they're produced and how they're made and all of these things. And like,
[762.10s -> 768.02s]  I mean, I tend to reuse a lot of stuff, you know, from like, my wife is really into like
[768.02s -> 773.78s]  mid-century stuff. So I've had to incorporate into pretty much everything I do, but like,
[774.50s -> 780.82s]  you know, old sinks and bathtubs and like, you know, like I, we just did redid our bathroom
[780.82s -> 785.14s]  in our house. And I like, I did this like mid-century tile, like wraparound thing,
[785.14s -> 790.18s]  which like I would never have done that on my own. Like she likes that. So it's like,
[790.18s -> 792.98s]  you know, it's just a lot of, yeah.
[793.70s -> 803.38s]  My in-laws live in like upstate New York and their house is probably 210 years old.
[804.10s -> 808.58s]  And I don't know a ton about architecture, but my father-in-law was just kind of remarking
[808.58s -> 812.58s]  on how it was built. And you look at the floorboards in that house and it's like these
[812.58s -> 819.38s]  like old growth trees that had like 600 rings to them, you know? And then I, so I see
[819.94s -> 823.30s]  like the floorboards in the house and just the everything, the foundation,
[823.30s -> 828.82s]  and I come back to Utah and like the materials are so fragile by comparison.
[830.26s -> 834.42s]  Yeah. I mean, that's the thing, right? So the, this is like a forestry question,
[834.42s -> 838.58s]  right? Like it's, or yeah, like we've like over, over-harvested all the trees.
[838.66s -> 843.30s]  Like everything's pine too. It's just like, so the types of wood that's being used, yeah,
[843.30s -> 848.58s]  they're like, it's not normal for trees to like grow that fast. So it's like when you're
[848.58s -> 853.94s]  using that wood, it's like not great. So, you know, people always, I hear these
[854.74s -> 859.06s]  in this conversation, you know, there's always guys like, well, we like, you actually want
[859.70s -> 863.86s]  like, people always say like, I want a brand new house. And it's like, okay, that's great.
[863.94s -> 870.66s]  And then there's like the, the, the carpentry guys are like, well, you actually want a house
[870.66s -> 873.86s]  that's like a hundred years old because it's like built a lot better. And what,
[873.86s -> 878.02s]  well, that's like maybe true, but you want a house that's built well a hundred years ago,
[878.82s -> 882.90s]  right? So it's like, I've seen a lot of houses from a lot of different generations
[882.90s -> 886.18s]  and whether it's building or whether it's anything, what I've like sort of come to
[886.18s -> 891.62s]  realize is that like, nothing is generational. Like anytime anyone blames anything for being
[891.62s -> 897.06s]  generational or like one generation is lazy or does things shitty or one does it well.
[897.06s -> 901.14s]  It's like, that's all made up. It's like nothing is generation. There are people that
[901.14s -> 904.98s]  do things well and good in this world and there are people that do things shittily and
[904.98s -> 909.46s]  as cheaply as they can. And that's always been true. So whether you buy a house from
[909.46s -> 916.58s]  like 1940 or a house from 2020, it's like, there are people building things today that are
[916.66s -> 922.34s]  fucking incredible, you know, that are like some of the most amazing things that have ever been
[922.34s -> 926.82s]  built. And then there's people building track homes in Salt Lake and in Prescott, you know,
[926.82s -> 931.30s]  it's like the same thing with old houses. Like I have an old house and it was like built
[932.10s -> 938.74s]  by lazy pieces of shit who were doing it as cheaply and as shittily as they possibly could.
[938.74s -> 942.82s]  It's like, so I've had to rebuild the whole thing. You know, so it's like, it's
[942.82s -> 951.06s]  all the same. And yeah, I mean, lumber sucks now, you know, but it's also like super available,
[952.50s -> 955.86s]  which it wasn't, you know, 100 or whatever. I don't know.
[955.86s -> 958.50s]  I feel like this question, you could apply it to sort of like any
[959.70s -> 965.70s]  avenue of life, but how like in like the home building space, you were saying,
[965.70s -> 968.82s]  you know, a lot of the industry is, I don't know if corrupt is the right word,
[968.82s -> 974.02s]  but just like misguided or not good at what they do. How easy was it for you to find
[974.02s -> 978.98s]  like the people doing it right for inspiration? I think it's pretty easy. I think that you get in
[979.70s -> 985.38s]  with certain, you find certain interest or like, you know, if you decide that you want to like,
[986.18s -> 992.91s]  I just feel like there's, it's about, that's funny. I was about to say our generation.
[994.99s -> 998.59s]  Like one thing our generation, I'll just say it, one thing our generation does is I feel
[998.59s -> 1003.47s]  like they like need, they feel the need. And again, this is not generational. This is everyone.
[1003.47s -> 1007.15s]  I feel the need that you need to get paid for like everything that you do.
[1007.15s -> 1012.19s]  Right. This is part of what I was talking about. And I think it's good to get paid
[1012.83s -> 1018.59s]  and to not be exploited by, you know, people, but it's also like my twenties and thirties.
[1020.59s -> 1025.55s]  Like you just learn how to do shit. You just like get good at something and learn how to do
[1025.55s -> 1029.23s]  something. So it's like, if I want to learn how to build a rammed earth house, for example,
[1030.11s -> 1035.63s]  it's like, I don't need to show up to the job and demand $50 an hour because like that's what
[1035.63s -> 1040.27s]  I, you know, or whatever. It's like, no, I'll just, how about I just like work this entire
[1040.27s -> 1044.83s]  house for free. And at the end of it, like, I know I don't, maybe don't know how, maybe I
[1044.83s -> 1048.35s]  can't do it myself, but at the end of that house, I know how to build a rammed earth house.
[1048.35s -> 1051.95s]  Yeah. Or I know how to like make Adobe bricks or I know how to like
[1051.95s -> 1056.91s]  whatever you have an interest in, like show up and just do it and don't expect to get paid,
[1056.91s -> 1059.23s]  especially when you're young, because it's easy to do when you're young.
[1059.23s -> 1059.87s]  Apprenticeship.
[1059.87s -> 1063.71s]  It's like, yeah, like whatever. I mean, the apprenticeship thing I think can become
[1064.51s -> 1073.71s]  exploitative, but it's like, I think if you can find the time to do those things,
[1073.71s -> 1078.59s]  like show up and just offer to help on job sites. And it's like by that, by in three
[1078.59s -> 1081.15s]  months, you'll, you know, you'll know how to do it.
[1081.15s -> 1084.75s]  So that was you like in central Arizona to go on job site to job site initially.
[1086.27s -> 1089.63s]  Kind of. Yeah. Even now, like, like, like for example, the rammed earth house,
[1089.63s -> 1092.83s]  like I don't like that. That's like the next house I wanted to build. I was like
[1092.83s -> 1096.83s]  considering doing a rammed earth house and there was a house being built by a friend
[1096.83s -> 1103.63s]  of a friend outside of Prescott. And it's like, you know, I'm 40 years old, but it's
[1103.63s -> 1108.19s]  like, and I ended up not because of like having to come here and like do all this
[1108.19s -> 1112.75s]  stuff. And this, it's just been a crazy summer, but it's like, like I want to go
[1112.75s -> 1116.91s]  there and show up and just work for like a week or two weeks or however much time
[1116.91s -> 1120.67s]  I can give to that because you're like learning how to do it. And like, that's
[1120.67s -> 1126.75s]  what is value valuable to me is like, you know, like I've never run a like
[1126.75s -> 1131.55s]  hydraulic tamper thing for rammed earth stuff. And so it's just like stuff like that,
[1131.55s -> 1135.79s]  that it's like, it's pretty easy. You just have to put yourself out there and be
[1135.79s -> 1138.51s]  like maybe a little bit vulnerable about stuff. And it's like,
[1142.19s -> 1146.67s]  I don't know what that doesn't like bother me to walk into a situation and say,
[1146.67s -> 1149.95s]  like, I know nothing about this. You know, like, let's just
[1154.93s -> 1159.97s]  What is like, when did you start getting into the home building process? Like how
[1159.97s -> 1163.97s]  many years ago? I sort of have like a adjacent question to it.
[1166.05s -> 1171.49s]  I don't know my, you know, it probably would when I, I mean, not, not everyone has the
[1171.49s -> 1175.41s]  ability to just go out and start building something, right? Like, you need land,
[1176.45s -> 1183.09s]  you need a place to do that. So it's like, so I think the first, you know, I bought,
[1183.09s -> 1190.21s]  I bought land in 2012 or 2011 or something like that. So the cabin I built out there,
[1190.21s -> 1194.85s]  that was like the first thing that I like built from the ground up, like built, you know,
[1194.85s -> 1200.69s]  and I had worked, you know, being a like vagrant for my younger 20s, like during
[1200.69s -> 1208.45s]  college and stuff, like all I, for my younger 20s, it was basically consisted of college and
[1208.45s -> 1212.93s]  hitchhiking. It's like, when you're like vagrant and like, kind of like a hobo like that,
[1212.93s -> 1218.21s]  or whatever you want to call it, it's like you find work where you just like find random
[1218.21s -> 1222.85s]  work and jobs. And oftentimes that's construction, right? Or like landscaping or like,
[1222.85s -> 1231.73s]  so I did a lot of that when I was younger, which I think is great for people to do that.
[1231.73s -> 1235.89s]  You know, it's like, it's, there's a lot of freedom associated with that rather than,
[1235.89s -> 1239.25s]  you know. What's, what's the, is there a new thing for you right now?
[1239.25s -> 1240.61s]  Where you're at the beginning of the learning curve?
[1245.09s -> 1251.17s]  Yeah, I mean, being a dad, you know, which you understand. Family, yeah, just like,
[1251.17s -> 1254.13s]  I mean, I'm like very domesticated the last couple of years.
[1255.09s -> 1258.93s]  Has that been, did you have doubts about whether that was going to be an appealing
[1258.93s -> 1265.89s]  lifestyle? Yeah, I didn't have doubts that I would, I thought that I would be good at it.
[1265.89s -> 1272.85s]  I've always thought that I would be a good dad. But yeah, whether or not it would be appealing.
[1274.21s -> 1278.13s]  But that was like the risk I was willing to take to in order to experience it.
[1279.17s -> 1282.29s]  Like I think I probably said on your podcast last time is like,
[1282.29s -> 1285.97s]  it could be the best or the worst decision I ever make having a kid, but I'm going to,
[1285.97s -> 1289.65s]  I'm going to try it. You said there's a before and an after.
[1289.65s -> 1294.21s]  Yes. But it's like, and luckily it's not, it's not ever the worst. Well,
[1294.21s -> 1298.69s]  that's not, I shouldn't say that for some people. It's like, it's not the worst is it's like the
[1298.69s -> 1307.52s]  best coolest thing ever. Yeah. So it's like, but that, yeah, like marital life is like,
[1307.52s -> 1314.16s]  you know, that all that stuff coming to Chamonix with my family, they're here.
[1319.97s -> 1326.61s]  I mean, there's a, there's, there's a lot of stuff if I actually like thought about it.
[1326.61s -> 1329.81s]  You know, I'm always, I get bored. I think that's like maybe a,
[1330.85s -> 1335.01s]  just a thing about my personalities. I get, I get bored pretty fast with things.
[1336.77s -> 1339.81s]  So it's actually like even like ultra running, like I'm blown away. I was actually,
[1339.81s -> 1346.29s]  so I was pacing Jamil at Hard Rock this year and I was like, we were talking about,
[1348.29s -> 1352.93s]  you know, I used to apply to Hard Rock like a decade ago. I think I like applied three or
[1352.93s -> 1357.89s]  four years ago and then I got all like, you know, negative about it. And it was like,
[1357.89s -> 1361.33s]  oh, fuck it. I'm never going to get into this race. And so I like stopped applying
[1361.33s -> 1364.53s]  applying and like fast forward like 10 years later, I'm still,
[1365.65s -> 1370.29s]  still running these races. It's like, fuck if I just like stuck with it, like I would
[1370.29s -> 1374.93s]  be in Hard Rock by now, you know, and it's like, and Jamil is like, yeah, just, you know,
[1374.93s -> 1380.69s]  just win UTMB and you'll get in Hard Rock. Like, no, no problem. But it's like,
[1382.05s -> 1386.13s]  is John Capus like a better experience than Hard Rock though? Do you anticipate?
[1387.33s -> 1392.05s]  It's different. I think John Capus is what Hard Rock was, you know, probably the first
[1392.05s -> 1397.81s]  couple of years. Well, I mean, not exactly the same, but it's like,
[1398.77s -> 1403.09s]  no, I think they're different. I still like, I think Hard Rock is great. I think
[1403.89s -> 1409.57s]  for all this, like for all the negativity that some people throw at Hard Rock, just because they
[1409.57s -> 1414.53s]  don't get into the race, essentially. The fact that they've been able to, it's pretty amazing.
[1414.53s -> 1421.39s]  And this is actually like, coming from my own experience with Saddles and being a racer,
[1421.39s -> 1425.23s]  like Saddles is selling out this year. And it's like three times the amount of people
[1425.23s -> 1431.87s]  that I ever even wanted at that race. And it's like, as a race director and as a,
[1431.87s -> 1436.51s]  in this sport right now, where every race, it's just like, there's so many people doing
[1436.51s -> 1441.31s]  the sport. There's just like, the fact that Hard Rock has been able to maintain
[1442.19s -> 1451.47s]  a sense of authenticity and like community is pretty amazing, actually. The fact that they
[1451.47s -> 1455.63s]  haven't gone the way of UTMB or like Western States and they've like held on to the, or
[1456.19s -> 1460.11s]  if like, I don't know, I sort of, maybe they have a little bit, but like,
[1461.39s -> 1466.35s]  they're like somewhere in the spectrum, right? Of like being closer to like
[1468.27s -> 1470.75s]  the Wasatch side of things or something. I don't know.
[1471.39s -> 1476.75s]  Do you have, I don't even, do you have a preservation strategy for Saddles?
[1477.87s -> 1482.03s]  Yeah, but they all suck. They just all fucking suck. And that's the problem. Like there's no
[1482.03s -> 1488.83s]  good way, in my opinion, you're always going to like piss some people off and you're always
[1488.83s -> 1500.78s]  going to like not, you're always going to have some level of like gatekeeping
[1501.42s -> 1507.18s]  that is going to upset some people. And it's like, but there's just no, in my opinion,
[1507.18s -> 1510.54s]  I haven't, I was actually talking with Jamil about this because he's having to deal with
[1510.54s -> 1517.66s]  it on a much larger scale for the first time with Cocodona. And it's like-
[1517.66s -> 1518.78s]  That sold out in minutes.
[1518.78s -> 1523.18s]  Well, I feel, well, yeah. So I feel like, I feel like the thing Hard Rock didn't do well
[1523.18s -> 1528.54s]  is like, they didn't just own that like, you know what, this is our race and we can do
[1528.54s -> 1533.10s]  whatever the fuck we want to do. Like, like, and I feel like as a race director,
[1533.74s -> 1538.22s]  if you just own that and like say that it's like, you know what, yeah, you know what,
[1538.22s -> 1542.22s]  this is like, I am going to let some of my friends in because it's my race and I can do
[1542.22s -> 1547.02s]  whatever the fuck I want to. Like if Hard Rock had just said that instead of like trying to like-
[1548.06s -> 1548.78s]  Toe a line or something.
[1548.78s -> 1551.58s]  Toe a line. I don't, you know, I, and again, I don't keep up with everything,
[1551.58s -> 1554.78s]  so I don't know all the like nuances and details of things, but it's like,
[1555.42s -> 1559.10s]  you're not going to please everybody. Just admit that it's your race and like own it
[1559.10s -> 1563.50s]  and move on. So that like, if anything, that's my strategy for saddles. Because like,
[1563.50s -> 1566.86s]  we need to come up with a number. And that's another thing too, is because everyone's like,
[1566.86s -> 1571.18s]  oh, just like raise the price or like have like, or like, it's like, well, I don't want
[1571.18s -> 1575.98s]  only people that can afford to pay $500 for 50 mile or to run my race or like,
[1575.98s -> 1582.06s]  or I also don't want like people who are just really good at like sitting on their computer
[1582.06s -> 1587.74s]  at midnight when something opens to like, I don't want like, what am I prioritizing here?
[1587.74s -> 1591.26s]  And then a wait list. And then I'm like picking people as I go, like, who am I picking?
[1591.26s -> 1595.10s]  Like people that like look like me and that I like, and I think are cool or like whatever.
[1595.82s -> 1602.38s]  There's just no great way of doing it. So like, other than like just fucking canceling the race
[1602.38s -> 1609.02s]  and like deleting, saying this is the last year of the race, like deleting all social media,
[1609.02s -> 1615.18s]  deleting all website branding, name, everything, and then just have the same race with all brand
[1615.18s -> 1621.66s]  new stuff the next year. And like, it's like an exercise in undermining my own business,
[1621.66s -> 1628.94s]  like every three years of like, because saddles again, I think we talked about this last time,
[1628.94s -> 1633.98s]  saddles to me is not like a bit, like that's the thing is that you're the first person out of a
[1633.98s -> 1639.34s]  lot that when I say like, oh, saddles is selling out. You didn't like cut me off and say,
[1639.34s -> 1644.70s]  oh, congratulations. Because it's like, it's not really my response or like how like I'm
[1644.70s -> 1651.34s]  wired to be like, is that like a congratulations? Because I'm not super stoked about there being
[1651.34s -> 1659.44s]  300 fucking people. It's like, like, I think you lose some like real, I don't know.
[1660.56s -> 1665.12s]  But I'm also running a race on Saturday with 1000 people or whatever.
[1665.12s -> 1673.44s]  Yeah, I mean, I think I actually think Barclay does a fantastic job at just owning the whole
[1673.44s -> 1677.76s]  like, it's not it's not going to be fair. And it's never going to be fair theme.
[1677.76s -> 1680.56s]  Exactly. And and they're fine, right? Like people like,
[1680.56s -> 1682.96s]  and they embrace it. If they get shots on them, they embrace it.
[1682.96s -> 1690.43s]  Exactly. And you just, yeah, you just like being being a dictator of your own
[1690.43s -> 1694.35s]  race is like, and Laz has done that, you know what I mean? And it's like,
[1694.35s -> 1698.91s]  because there's no other way to it. It's impossible to be fair.
[1700.43s -> 1702.43s]  It sounds like there's a part of your personality, though,
[1702.43s -> 1708.27s]  that feels pressure to be accommodating. Yeah, totally. That's the thing is like,
[1708.27s -> 1713.79s]  you know, I like blow a lot of wind about like, especially at saddles, right about like,
[1714.59s -> 1718.83s]  like, like the aid stations are going to suck. We're not doing anything for you like this.
[1718.83s -> 1724.59s]  And it's like, actually, like, really nice. I get like, really, like, if a runner gets
[1724.59s -> 1728.51s]  lost, I get really stressed out about it. And it's like, like the first year, like,
[1730.03s -> 1733.95s]  some like bulldozers came through and like took some markings and signs with them and stuff.
[1733.95s -> 1738.51s]  And like, the guy who was in second place got super lost. I'm like, dude,
[1738.51s -> 1743.47s]  like free entry next year. And I get like really stressed out if anyone's like not having a great
[1743.47s -> 1747.95s]  time, you know, so it's like, and that's probably actually what stresses me out about
[1747.95s -> 1752.59s]  the 300 people is the fact that I know that I can't, I can't guarantee that for everybody.
[1753.23s -> 1757.63s]  And that is like that maybe that's ego on my end, because I feel like that reflects like
[1757.63s -> 1762.27s]  poorly on me. But it's like, or like last year was super hot. And we were having issues
[1762.27s -> 1766.43s]  with like getting enough ice to every like to the lead runners and like the lead 50
[1766.43s -> 1770.67s]  milers in time and just like the amount of electrolyte we were burning through.
[1770.67s -> 1777.63s]  And I like freaked out on some of my crew. Because it's just like, it's just like,
[1777.63s -> 1781.71s]  you know, and it's like, so anyway, airvipe is taking over aid stations this year. So
[1781.71s -> 1786.67s]  it's like, they should be, you know, better. They're professionals. And but it's like,
[1787.23s -> 1788.59s]  yeah.
[1788.59s -> 1794.16s]  We'll come back to, I don't want to, this just came to mind, you know, if I,
[1796.08s -> 1801.52s]  if someone was to ask me like, how would you characterize Mike as a runner, I would say like
[1801.52s -> 1809.76s]  your biggest trait is you're super good at handling a moment that you're inexperienced
[1809.76s -> 1815.20s]  for, you know, like you can just get out of like tough situations. And like,
[1815.84s -> 1819.76s]  yeah, we on the last conversation, man, like you did that great Alaskan race or whatever it's
[1819.76s -> 1825.84s]  called. And it was like dire. And like, I would have thought you would have been like perfect
[1825.84s -> 1829.68s]  for Barkley. Like, how come Barkley didn't work for you? Well, Barkley is just a weird
[1829.68s -> 1836.91s]  thing. So Barkley, the, I mean, so the year I ran with the year was like Gary's like six
[1836.91s -> 1845.54s]  seconds. Oh, that was okay. And the beginning of that race, Gary, Gary, because I've known
[1845.54s -> 1850.42s]  Gary for a long time. So like Gary and John Kelly and myself decided that three of us were going
[1850.42s -> 1854.66s]  to like be together as a group. Cause for whatever reasons, those guys had confidence in
[1854.66s -> 1859.46s]  me. Like they had both been there before. So I was like, great. Like to stay, to be able to
[1859.46s -> 1863.78s]  stay with those two at your first time running Barkley is like sort of the dream,
[1863.78s -> 1867.62s]  right? Cause like that's how, that's the only way in my opinion, you can be successful
[1867.62s -> 1872.58s]  at Barkley in your first year is to be taken around by somebody like that.
[1872.82s -> 1879.54s]  Yeah. Um, I mean, you saw that in the documentary, right? It was, uh, uh, but, uh,
[1882.10s -> 1888.50s]  the, the year that I, uh, you know, a long Barkley story relatively short is that the
[1888.50s -> 1892.58s]  year that we ran was like a, I think it was like a one or two in the morning wake up
[1893.46s -> 1898.50s]  and it was pouring rain and the visibility, it was so cloudy and foggy, like you couldn't
[1898.50s -> 1902.74s]  see your own feet with your headlamp. And so like, you're kind of your, when you're
[1902.74s -> 1906.82s]  running with these groups, you're kind of like, you can kind of see this like light.
[1906.82s -> 1910.74s]  That's kind of like where you like, where I knew were John and Gary were while we're
[1910.74s -> 1915.94s]  like running down to that like first book and second book or whatever. And at some point
[1915.94s -> 1921.14s]  in that first lap, we came to a Creek and we didn't, we couldn't find the book. We didn't
[1921.14s -> 1926.42s]  know exactly where we were. And it was again, like one of the first couple of books on the
[1926.42s -> 1933.70s]  first lap and Jamil and the group he was in, like came down behind us and they were on the
[1933.70s -> 1940.74s]  other side of the Creek. And I, I told Gary and John, I was like, Oh, I'm going to go ask
[1940.74s -> 1945.46s]  Jamil. If he like knows where the book is. And I like crossed the Creek and I asked Jamil
[1945.46s -> 1949.86s]  and I turned around and I never saw Gary and John like for the rest of the race.
[1950.90s -> 1955.22s]  It was like, cause it was the visibility was just like too poor. So I ended up doing,
[1955.22s -> 1959.86s]  I ended up doing like a lap and a half with, with Jamil and the group he was in. And
[1961.70s -> 1970.10s]  what I decided was that I couldn't stay with, with that group because the pace that they were
[1970.10s -> 1977.14s]  going, they weren't going to finish. So I decided I needed to try and catch back up to
[1978.10s -> 1982.50s]  John and Gary. And within a few hours, I was just, it was the middle of the night
[1982.50s -> 1986.66s]  and it was like completely lost. I ended up on a highway and I hitchhiked back to the
[1987.38s -> 1998.85s]  finish line and that was it. So it was like, yeah. And so like, I think that
[2005.76s -> 2009.92s]  whatever people spend energy, like trying to convince you that they're not like,
[2009.92s -> 2013.52s]  they probably are a little bit. It's like,
[2014.48s -> 2015.76s]  Wait, what's the example of that?
[2015.76s -> 2023.70s]  Well, like, I don't know, like, like whatever you spend time defending,
[2025.22s -> 2029.94s]  like whatever you spend time defending yourself against, like you're probably a little bit of
[2029.94s -> 2036.58s]  that. So, so like what I'm saying is that like, like Barkley, I feel like in conversation
[2036.58s -> 2041.30s]  and like Laz and things like they, they, they spend some time defending that like they're
[2041.30s -> 2049.55s]  not a scavenger hunt or that they're like, they're not, they're not these certain things.
[2049.55s -> 2053.47s]  And it's like, well, you're pretty much like a glorified scavenger hunt. It's like,
[2053.47s -> 2057.39s]  if you didn't, if you like, for example, if you didn't have to spend most of your time
[2057.39s -> 2063.31s]  looking for books, like hidden under rocks and like, I mean, they're not hidden that hard,
[2063.31s -> 2070.51s]  like they're, they're kind of, but it's like, I really love, and I'm not saying
[2070.51s -> 2074.03s]  anything negative about Barkley. I love what Laz has done with his events. I think that
[2074.03s -> 2077.87s]  he's a really creative person, really intelligent person and thoughtful person,
[2077.87s -> 2082.91s]  everything we've been talking about. And I think what he's created there is like really awesome,
[2082.91s -> 2090.91s]  is really amazing. But I don't, the allure of Barkley itself is kind of lost on me because
[2090.91s -> 2098.83s]  like it, you know, getting up to the top of this like big rounded mountain top
[2099.79s -> 2103.47s]  and visibility is three feet and I need to like find this fucking book.
[2104.91s -> 2109.47s]  You know what I mean? It's like, it's like Barkley is hard. The course is hard. It's like,
[2109.47s -> 2115.39s]  but if you had a GPS route, for example, if you were allowed a route, like there,
[2115.39s -> 2120.03s]  there would be a ton of finishers every single year. Like the hardest part of that,
[2120.03s -> 2125.87s]  that course is staying on course, especially with bad weather. It's not, it's not the
[2126.03s -> 2130.43s]  terrain. It's not the course. And not to say that it's easy. It's all super difficult. It's
[2130.43s -> 2137.39s]  all super hard, but it's not as hard. It's not like whatever the number is, 18 finishers in
[2137.39s -> 2143.55s]  30 years or whatever. It's not like that hard, you know. So you don't, yeah, you don't feel
[2143.55s -> 2148.51s]  like you were tested physically. It's more so just like, well, you are tested physically,
[2148.51s -> 2152.99s]  just not to the point. It's not like, because like that's the thing is like Barkley
[2152.99s -> 2158.03s]  gets this reputation of being like, oh, it's like, found this thing of being like right at the limit
[2158.03s -> 2162.99s]  of like human endurance and stuff. And it's like, well, not really. It's like, again,
[2162.99s -> 2168.83s]  if you had a GPS track, there'd be half the people would finish every year. And it's fucking
[2168.83s -> 2172.91s]  hard. And I, again, I know I say this three times already. I'm not trying to make Barkley
[2172.91s -> 2178.03s]  sound easy. It's still really fucking hard. But so is Cocadona. So it was like any of
[2178.03s -> 2182.19s]  these things, you know, like running Cocadona in 60 hours, like how many people do that a
[2182.19s -> 2188.99s]  year? Yeah, I think the only thing I would say about Cocadona compared to Barkley is
[2191.15s -> 2195.55s]  they're definitely setting up, like I do think Cocadona, even though Cocadona is super hard,
[2196.27s -> 2200.43s]  Eravipa is still creating an experience designed to get people to the finish line.
[2201.23s -> 2205.55s]  Totally, because it doesn't have a 60 hour cutoff. Yeah. Well, yeah, it's got whatever,
[2205.55s -> 2209.39s]  125 or whatever. That's what I mean. Like if you had a 60 hour cutoff at Cocadona.
[2209.39s -> 2214.67s]  Yeah. Okay. Great point. Like you'd see about as many finishers as Barkley.
[2215.55s -> 2219.47s]  So it's like, and that's, that's another thing I don't love about Barkley. Like you can make any,
[2219.47s -> 2224.83s]  you can make any superlative you want to out of anything by adding loops.
[2226.19s -> 2230.35s]  It's like, it's just a contrived thing in general. And again, I like Barkley. I'm not,
[2230.35s -> 2235.63s]  I'm not, I'm not, but, but it is super contrived. It's like, well, every, like
[2235.63s -> 2239.47s]  backyards are contracted, but there's nothing wrong with being contrived. I'm just saying that,
[2239.47s -> 2242.59s]  like, you can make anything the hardest in the world. If you just keep adding loops.
[2243.79s -> 2248.03s]  So it's like hard rock. Oh, like do it a second time. Okay. Now you have the hardest race
[2248.03s -> 2252.35s]  in the world. It's like, if you just keep adding loops to things, it's pretty easy.
[2252.35s -> 2256.59s]  So like, it just turns out that five loops at Barkley is like that sweet spot that they
[2256.59s -> 2262.99s]  found. That's like achievable, but really difficult. Do you think if you had kept going
[2262.99s -> 2269.71s]  on loops, the, the memory of where things were on the course would have been there for you?
[2269.71s -> 2273.95s]  I think so. But it was also when I, yeah, I think, I think in hindsight,
[2273.95s -> 2276.91s]  if I had done something different, it was probably like, wait till the morning to
[2276.91s -> 2280.91s]  try and make your move to catch up to those guys. But that's the thing. You only,
[2280.91s -> 2287.79s]  you only see the loops twice. Like whether even if you do four loops,
[2287.79s -> 2291.87s]  because you're doing them in different directions and then, and then half of that is at night.
[2292.59s -> 2297.79s]  So you're not learning anything at night. Well, you're learning a little bit, but it's like,
[2298.99s -> 2304.27s]  it's why it takes a few years of being out at Barkley for most people to be successful
[2304.27s -> 2310.27s]  because it's, it's, you have to like learn the course like quite a bit. And then once you do
[2310.27s -> 2315.71s]  that, then it becomes, then it becomes the physical feat thing. Can you do it in 60 hours?
[2315.71s -> 2319.95s]  Then it's more of a physical feat because you're not spending all this time trying to
[2320.11s -> 2323.87s]  look for things or being lost or wondering if you're going the right direction.
[2323.87s -> 2328.35s]  Once you know the course, which again, because supposedly, right, you're not allowed,
[2328.35s -> 2335.47s]  you're not allowed to go out there, which is like people go out there and it's just like,
[2335.47s -> 2340.83s]  admit it, you know, it's like, you're not allowed to go out there and train on the
[2340.83s -> 2347.47s]  course any other day of the year. So it's like, but yeah.
[2347.47s -> 2351.87s]  Do you remember what you wrote in your letter to Laz? Is any of that?
[2353.55s -> 2353.87s]  Not really.
[2353.87s -> 2356.27s]  Was it just like displaying the facts of your career or was it?
[2356.27s -> 2361.95s]  No, I was super like smart alecky about everything. I didn't take any of it serious.
[2361.95s -> 2365.79s]  I think every question on the essay, I just like made up a completely,
[2365.79s -> 2372.27s]  I just made up an entire story. That's why that's one thing I feel like too is like,
[2373.23s -> 2379.47s]  I mean, with that stuff, like, I remember one question is like, please describe like,
[2380.03s -> 2385.23s]  how like how St. Elmo's fire works. It's like, I don't think Laz is really looking
[2385.23s -> 2389.39s]  for like a Wikipedia description of like St. Elmo's fire or whatever. It's like,
[2390.51s -> 2394.43s]  he's like bored reading through these fucking applications. And it's like, you know,
[2396.66s -> 2400.82s]  I don't know. I can't, I'm not, I don't know what goes to that guy's head, but
[2401.38s -> 2406.10s]  I think I just, at the time I just sat there as on a trail FKT. So it was like,
[2406.10s -> 2411.86s]  he, he does do good kind of about like letting in people who like people who he thinks can be
[2411.86s -> 2417.94s]  successful at Berkeley. He's pretty good about, you know, trying to let those people
[2417.94s -> 2425.70s]  have a shot at it. So I think plus the, you know, Jamil connection helps. I don't know.
[2426.42s -> 2429.86s]  Well, I think one of the reasons why I brought up the like carpentry stuff
[2430.66s -> 2436.34s]  the home building stuff earlier is and like, obviously, if we got into like you, you know,
[2436.34s -> 2440.50s]  your teaching background stuff, that'd be cool too. But like, I think when we interview a
[2440.50s -> 2447.06s]  lot of people, oh, should we get coffee? Yeah. Okay. I think when we interview a lot
[2447.06s -> 2456.35s]  of people in the sport, I, I get, I definitely find myself getting caught up
[2456.43s -> 2461.55s]  in being impressed by how invested people are in the sport. Like that's almost a badge of honor.
[2461.55s -> 2465.55s]  It's like, oh, you've, you've taken the sport to this length. Like, yeah, it's like admirable.
[2465.55s -> 2469.31s]  Yeah. And I think, I think I do get caught up in that and I still do. And so I think it's
[2469.31s -> 2475.15s]  interesting to talk with you because you've done a pretty good job. Even though you're
[2475.15s -> 2477.39s]  getting involved in like race directing and stuff, you've done a pretty good job at
[2477.39s -> 2484.19s]  keeping the sport at an arm's length. Yeah, I would agree with that. I think running is a
[2484.19s -> 2496.74s]  thing that I do. That I'm, you know, I, I, I excel at running, you know, I'm like a better,
[2496.74s -> 2501.46s]  like, you know, I climb probably as much as I run. I'm just not good at climbing or,
[2501.46s -> 2504.66s]  you know, I'm just like, I don't have sponsors in rock climbing. So it's like,
[2507.30s -> 2512.26s]  especially from a public like persona, I understand why people think I'm an ultra runner
[2512.26s -> 2518.90s]  because like, that's why my social media accounts exist for the running obligations that I have.
[2520.66s -> 2526.34s]  But you are right in the sense that running has always been a part of my life, but it doesn't,
[2526.90s -> 2536.66s]  it doesn't feel like it. I don't like have an identity that's tied to, to running.
[2536.90s -> 2544.58s]  Um, and that's probably, you know, I also like, don't think I'm like great at running. I think
[2544.58s -> 2549.54s]  I'm good at running, you know what I mean? Like I've never like, I've never won a big race,
[2549.54s -> 2553.70s]  you know, it's like, I've never won it. Like, like, I think that I do well at it,
[2553.70s -> 2558.90s]  but it's also probably why I've never been great at it. Um, from a, from a competitive
[2558.90s -> 2564.90s]  one, yeah, but I mean, let's be honest, it's like not a competitive race that first year.
[2565.54s -> 2567.54s]  Oh, but you had to figure it out for the next gen.
[2568.18s -> 2574.18s]  I agree with that. But that also I'm being a pioneer, but I don't know if that's like
[2574.18s -> 2583.06s]  necessary. Like, yeah, that's fine. And I can, I can accept that and appreciate that. But
[2583.06s -> 2592.42s]  it's like, um, it's also just acknowledging that like, you know, you know, like I just
[2592.42s -> 2602.29s]  won Tushers a few weeks ago and it's like the, not every race is like a big deal. I mean,
[2602.29s -> 2606.53s]  I mean to like win a race, it just like, it doesn't like, like, like there's been a lot
[2606.53s -> 2611.01s]  of conversation about like what I could do at UTMB this weekend. Like let's say that I have
[2611.01s -> 2616.05s]  like my best race in my life. And I would say, even if I had the best race in my life,
[2616.05s -> 2621.49s]  I think it would be amazing to get top 10 at UTMB. Like a top 10 at UTMB from a
[2621.49s -> 2627.33s]  competitive standpoint is like probably a bigger deal than any win I've ever had in my career.
[2628.45s -> 2633.81s]  Just strictly from that competitive, like performance, right? And it's like,
[2634.61s -> 2639.17s]  um, I don't, I don't know what I'm talking about anymore, but it's like the, um,
[2641.78s -> 2648.18s]  yeah, like the run running to me, it's also opened like a lot of doors for me,
[2648.82s -> 2653.94s]  right? And so like, you know, 10 years ago when I was here on a bicycle,
[2653.94s -> 2658.66s]  I camped next to the lake in a tent for two weeks and like now I'm in a
[2658.66s -> 2664.18s]  fucking mansion with a hot tub. You know what I mean? Like both are cool, but I,
[2665.46s -> 2671.78s]  I kind of hate, I mean, I'm the, I have a family, right? Like I'm not going to like,
[2671.78s -> 2677.94s]  are you anti-indulgence? Very much so to the, to the, to the fault, maybe to a fault. And,
[2677.94s -> 2684.34s]  and it actually like a noise satisfy because they like get me these nice places and all I
[2684.34s -> 2691.30s]  do is complain about it. And it's like, as like you guys, like, like, like when I go to Paris
[2691.30s -> 2698.34s]  and they get me a hotel and like, like, you know, downtown Paris for like two weeks,
[2698.34s -> 2701.86s]  it's like, you guys, you could have bought me a fucking Sprinter van. And I just like,
[2701.86s -> 2707.70s]  could have had the van or something, but like, you're like, I don't need this hotel. I can sleep
[2707.70s -> 2711.70s]  like in the office or like on somebody's sleep on Tommy's couch or something. You know what
[2711.70s -> 2717.78s]  I mean? It's like, so it stresses me out. Like even though it's not my money and even
[2717.78s -> 2724.02s]  though it's not like that kind of stuff, like stresses me out. Like I'm sleeping in,
[2724.02s -> 2727.62s]  I'm actually like sleeping in a van. I'm actually, what's funny is that like,
[2727.62s -> 2732.10s]  so I, they got this big, you know, they have the athlete house and then the brand house
[2732.10s -> 2737.14s]  sort of like most brands do when they come to Chamonix. It's not like abnormal or whatever,
[2737.14s -> 2746.11s]  but yeah, currently we're like, I'm going back and forth between sleeping in the van
[2746.11s -> 2753.31s]  and I threw a mattress in the laundry room. So I'm sleeping next to the washing machine
[2753.31s -> 2757.31s]  right now, which is really funny because I'm the only person on the team or anyone running
[2757.31s -> 2762.75s]  UTMB and I'm the only person without a bedroom, but that's my fault. It's not that they didn't
[2762.75s -> 2766.83s]  offer it and extend it. It's just when I turned it down, they offered up the beds
[2766.83s -> 2771.87s]  to other people. So it's like, but it's just a funny, it's, it's a funny thing that I have
[2771.87s -> 2778.11s]  like, like it's too a fault where it's like, I feel like it's just like, I just feel
[2782.16s -> 2785.44s]  like I would never, even though I'm like with my wife and baby and we should probably
[2785.44s -> 2789.68s]  like have the master bedroom, like with the bathroom and like the, you know, overlooking
[2789.68s -> 2796.24s]  the valley and it's like, well, I'll just, I'll just take the laundry room. You know, it's like,
[2798.08s -> 2801.52s]  So like eternal vigilance for your principles.
[2801.52s -> 2806.72s]  It's not even, I don't even know. It's maybe it's just like habit or something or it's,
[2808.40s -> 2812.74s]  um, I don't know what it is.
[2813.30s -> 2816.90s]  Is it, did you learn that or is it like in your family genetic?
[2816.90s -> 2817.86s]  I have no idea.
[2819.22s -> 2820.66s]  Like is your mom or dad like that?
[2823.30s -> 2827.54s]  I don't think so. No, I think that they would both like, oh, like they're, you know,
[2827.54s -> 2832.02s]  other people are paying for it. Like you should flirt, you know, go for it. And it's like that
[2832.02s -> 2837.62s]  just kind of stresses me out more than if it was like my own money. You know, I mean,
[2837.62s -> 2840.34s]  but that's been a lot. I am getting better at it. I mean, for the first,
[2841.38s -> 2845.78s]  for the first like a year of being sponsored by satisfy, I refused to take any money
[2845.78s -> 2851.30s]  because I was like, no, it ruins everything. Like if we want a relationship to last,
[2851.54s -> 2856.58s]  we can't introduce money. Like there can be perks, but like we can't introduce money.
[2856.58s -> 2860.90s]  And then, and then even like, I remember the first thing they did. The first thing I did was
[2860.90s -> 2866.58s]  satisfy was like, I was sponsored by satisfy like two weeks before the first year of propadona.
[2866.58s -> 2869.78s]  And they're like, Oh, like, like, can we like send you shirts? Like, do you like
[2869.78s -> 2874.50s]  need anything? I was like, you guys really don't have to like send me a shirt. It's fine.
[2874.50s -> 2878.82s]  And it's like, like, well, no, we kind of want you to like wear our shirt. You know,
[2879.54s -> 2882.50s]  well, what was what was the relationship going to be then in your mind?
[2882.50s -> 2886.74s]  I don't know. But I was just at that point, at that point, too, there were other things going
[2886.74s -> 2893.46s]  on. I was so jaded when it came to any relationship brands, because it just fucking
[2893.46s -> 2898.34s]  sucked. In my opinion, like the the the athlete brand relationship was just super
[2900.34s -> 2904.98s]  not good. So I was like, I was really hesitant to like, I mean, that's like the
[2905.06s -> 2909.14s]  initially when satisfy reached out, I said, like, thanks, but no, thanks. And then like,
[2909.14s -> 2913.30s]  that obviously changed because of who they are and who I am. But
[2915.22s -> 2920.02s]  it was like, I was just very skeptical of anything in the brand. And I still am. I mean,
[2920.02s -> 2923.70s]  it's like the fact that I have to like come to Chamonix every year. That sounds super
[2923.70s -> 2929.14s]  spoiled. I know. I know what that sounded like. Like that. But like, like, no, I mean,
[2929.14s -> 2934.02s]  but like, I don't like, or like, maybe actually, the the running event is a better
[2934.02s -> 2939.06s]  example, the fact that I have to go to like expos. I don't have to be this is strong
[2939.06s -> 2942.66s]  language that I'm using. I don't have to do anything. But the fact that they like,
[2943.62s -> 2949.70s]  invite me and appreciate like, I feel like I should go to like expos. Like, I don't,
[2949.70s -> 2953.94s]  as you I mean, you know me a little bit, but as anyone knows, I don't have any business
[2953.94s -> 2959.46s]  being at a running expo, like talking to people about like marketing and like, and just
[2959.46s -> 2965.14s]  like, you know, but I, that's, that's what I mean about like, I have to come to Chamonix
[2965.14s -> 2970.50s]  every year, like, like the brand and the expo and the like, and all and just being
[2970.50s -> 2977.18s]  a sponsored athlete, right? Like, there's a, there's a, there's certain concessions
[2977.18s -> 2981.42s]  and compromises I have to make if I'm going to exist in this world. Like I,
[2981.42s -> 2986.78s]  I understand that I'm to a point a public figure and I'm part of a company's marketing
[2986.78s -> 2992.22s]  department. So there are certain, even if it's the best agreement and situation that exists,
[2992.22s -> 2996.86s]  in my opinion, in the ultra running community, there still are certain things.
[2999.42s -> 3005.90s]  Like I have to be a public figure, which that in general is a difficult thing for me.
[3005.90s -> 3009.50s]  So there are still are compromises to be made. And it's like,
[3009.98s -> 3019.90s]  um, and I know a lot of athletes that choose to not be a part of it, you know, that,
[3021.26s -> 3026.94s]  that are less tolerant than I am of it. And so they choose to not participate in it.
[3027.74s -> 3032.06s]  And I think especially that's especially more common in other sports, like climbing,
[3032.06s -> 3036.22s]  especially, I think there's a lot of people that like, it's just not worth it. And in the
[3036.22s -> 3044.14s]  modern age of like, predatory, like brand athletes, sponsorship relationships, I think
[3044.14s -> 3047.58s]  that there are a lot of people that are deciding it's just not worth it.
[3048.78s -> 3054.46s]  Is there any version of promotion for something that sits well with you?
[3054.46s -> 3063.02s]  I think that there probably is, but I would be uncomfortable with it just personally. And
[3063.02s -> 3066.22s]  that's not to say that like, I don't like, I understand that, like,
[3068.61s -> 3073.33s]  I understand why the industry exists. And like, you have to like promote things.
[3074.05s -> 3077.01s]  Like, like, like, I understand that. But
[3082.21s -> 3091.25s]  I do think that there is I mean, there's a there's a there's a point at which like,
[3091.25s -> 3095.73s]  how much is enough for like, how far you like, it's actually like a lot of my like,
[3095.73s -> 3104.13s]  issues with UTMB is like, it's not with actually this race. Specifically, like this race is
[3104.13s -> 3109.97s]  amazing. It's what they've exported, like the course, the towns, the community, the race itself,
[3109.97s -> 3114.77s]  it's an incredible experience. But it's like, that's, that's kind of what I'm talking about
[3114.77s -> 3121.09s]  is like, why can't you just be content with having the biggest, most successful, profitable
[3121.81s -> 3129.41s]  race in the fucking world? Why do you have to then move into other markets and be shitty
[3129.97s -> 3134.45s]  to like local communities and be shitty to local race directors? Like, it's just like,
[3134.45s -> 3138.29s]  why can't you just be content with already being the most successful thing in our sport?
[3138.93s -> 3141.89s]  You know what I mean? And so like, there's a level of promotion, there's a level of
[3141.89s -> 3147.17s]  advertising, there's a level of marketing that is, and I'm not the one to draw this line,
[3148.05s -> 3153.49s]  I have no idea, but I just know that there's like a certain point where it's like, it feels
[3155.17s -> 3160.37s]  like, like, do we, how many fucking Hoka pylons do we really need at this race? Like,
[3162.69s -> 3170.37s]  Pierre is like my crew, the like, ex-Solomon guy, he's my crew this year. He was telling
[3170.37s -> 3175.09s]  me about the like, the Hoka pylon like tunnel we all run through. That's like a thing
[3175.09s -> 3182.21s]  at this course now. It's like, is that really like, that's what our sport is now? Well,
[3182.21s -> 3186.69s]  we get to run through advertising banners, we get to run through billboards for them. Like,
[3186.69s -> 3192.21s]  that's the direction we're headed. It's like, I don't know. So again, there's just a point
[3193.57s -> 3201.62s]  where it's like, and I don't know what that point is. And this is just my personal opinion,
[3201.62s -> 3207.62s]  and I am the wrong person to be the judge of any of this stuff, because I don't love the industry.
[3211.86s -> 3216.98s]  So I feel like I'm a little cynical too, just about like the pylon concept. But then if I was
[3216.98s -> 3224.58s]  to step back and just think about why that would exist and why that's the case, I just think
[3224.58s -> 3229.94s]  it comes down to human intelligence. And if you don't think we need those pylons,
[3229.94s -> 3234.82s]  you have a lot more faith than maybe I do in like average human intelligence and how discerning
[3234.82s -> 3239.30s]  people are about like what's present in their environment. Like I think people need things
[3239.30s -> 3244.10s]  right in their face to get the message that people are putting across. And so the pylon
[3244.10s -> 3248.34s]  thing is just like, it needs to be that obvious. I ran Kodiak a couple of years ago.
[3249.38s -> 3255.38s]  I think it was the first year that UTMB took over. And it was like, the only thing,
[3257.58s -> 3264.91s]  like, like, I don't, I don't, you know, there's still a lot of people at Kodiak that are like,
[3264.91s -> 3268.51s]  have been there for a long time. And it's like, and, and so I don't, I don't mean to
[3268.51s -> 3273.47s]  be critical of like any other race director, like race, putting on races is fucking hard.
[3273.47s -> 3281.15s]  But what I can be critical is that like, like, you sold the race to this entity.
[3282.03s -> 3286.51s]  And that entity made certain promises about how we can come in and improve the race and
[3286.51s -> 3291.55s]  improve runner experience. And it's like, there wasn't soup at aid stations. I was like,
[3291.55s -> 3295.87s]  how do I have better aid stations at saddles than this like UTMB event?
[3296.99s -> 3303.79s]  And like, the only thing I noticed was that there were fucking Hoka pylons everywhere,
[3303.79s -> 3308.75s]  like going up the ski resort, like going, and it's just like, and just other than like
[3308.75s -> 3314.75s]  advertising and marketing and like you guys, like you guys are coming in, you're skimming
[3314.75s -> 3319.31s]  whatever money you're skimming off the top and that you're just using it for free real estate.
[3320.11s -> 3325.23s]  Right now the Kodiak course is free real estate for UTMB and Hoka to just continue their
[3325.23s -> 3329.87s]  advertising. It's like, if that's all you're going to bring to the race, then fuck off.
[3330.91s -> 3333.95s]  Because there's this argument that like, oh, well, they're like, they're like,
[3333.95s -> 3337.15s]  they're actually doing good for the sport. And they're like helping the races and they're
[3337.15s -> 3342.03s]  helping the race directors. And I think that's a real and valid argument if it's taking place.
[3342.99s -> 3350.59s]  But if they're not, which I, you know, you know, I didn't personally notice anything at Kodiak
[3350.59s -> 3355.07s]  that like they brought that was like improved runner experience. It was just like,
[3355.07s -> 3359.23s]  they just have a store set up at the start finish line and are like selling shoes and
[3359.23s -> 3364.83s]  they have advertising everywhere. And that to me is not beneficial or it doesn't improve
[3364.83s -> 3368.83s]  the atmosphere, the environment or the running runner experience in any way.
[3369.79s -> 3374.59s]  And so like talk shit about like saddles or talk shit about like satisfy all you want to
[3374.59s -> 3379.79s]  or like the aid station at Kokedona, but at least it's like a memorable runner experience
[3379.79s -> 3385.79s]  thing. You may love it or hate it, but it's like, they show up. They show up and try and
[3385.79s -> 3391.23s]  make runner experience more interesting and more enjoyable for the runners. And like,
[3392.27s -> 3397.15s]  it's like, and I just don't see that. And again, I don't run, I don't run races very
[3397.47s -> 3402.75s]  much, let alone UTMB races. So I can't speak to all of that. And there probably are circumstances
[3402.75s -> 3411.47s]  where they are doing good things. I would hope. But that's typically not how we see like
[3412.51s -> 3422.67s]  things in our society, right? It's like mergers and like profitability and accountants and like
[3422.67s -> 3433.63s]  all these things don't typically like customer satisfaction or experience is typically not
[3434.19s -> 3445.34s]  why those things happen. Do you? Because I know in myself, I have to suppress it and fight it
[3445.34s -> 3450.06s]  on a daily basis. Because I do think if you don't, it can be a really bad thing. But
[3451.02s -> 3455.34s]  is is ambition an issue for you? Or are you someone that doesn't really have too much
[3455.34s -> 3459.34s]  ambition in life? And I mean that in like a scaling way, like, obviously, you want to
[3459.34s -> 3462.62s]  do things well and correctly and provide like a great experience for people. But like,
[3463.42s -> 3469.18s]  are you someone that has to fight these like urges to make something bigger or make more
[3469.18s -> 3480.10s]  money, stuff like that? Um, I mean, I would I would be lying if I didn't say I had some
[3480.10s -> 3494.50s]  ambition. You know, I think that or like, like I, I do I do want to do well in things.
[3495.22s -> 3498.98s]  Like there is there is a part of even at like a race like UTMB, like,
[3500.10s -> 3506.66s]  there's a part of me that wants to do really well. And I think that that's okay. But I
[3506.66s -> 3516.72s]  don't necessarily I think I think I can I think I've I'm good at the skill I've
[3516.72s -> 3520.64s]  honed is like, sort of like zooming out on my own sort of life and my own
[3521.76s -> 3528.48s]  how I exist in the world and seeing that becoming really obsessed with anything is
[3528.48s -> 3535.20s]  like not super healthy. And I think that I can go through phases where I can be obsessive.
[3535.20s -> 3538.24s]  I think I think like most people in the sport, whether it's like,
[3538.24s -> 3542.88s]  you were saying that the athletes that become completely obsessed with how devoted can they get
[3542.88s -> 3548.24s]  how devoted can I think I do have those aspects of my personality. But I think I'm able
[3548.24s -> 3557.28s]  to like, like, I'm able to sort of move it around a little bit. So I think everything I do
[3557.28s -> 3561.84s]  is a little obsessive. But it's just not on like one specific thing.
[3562.80s -> 3572.32s]  And I think that that especially like the money thing, you know, like the success thing,
[3572.32s -> 3577.12s]  like I'm a little more conscious of it now, you know, having a family and stuff, but it's
[3583.33s -> 3590.99s]  in a lot of ways, if I feel like I've been pretty lucky in life and like thing, you know,
[3590.99s -> 3598.32s]  things have, I haven't had to like, worry about that stuff a whole lot, you know, I think
[3598.32s -> 3604.61s]  I've been able to like, but I think that's something that like people say, right is like,
[3605.09s -> 3610.93s]  like money, money comes and goes. And it sort of like, if you focus on what you like,
[3611.49s -> 3617.33s]  really care about, or what you're passionate about, like that stuff usually works itself out
[3617.33s -> 3622.05s]  in some ways, you know what I mean? And not to say that, I mean, I'm not to say that
[3622.05s -> 3627.01s]  like people don't have to be deliberate and like, intentional with everything they do. But
[3627.97s -> 3632.96s]  um, yeah.
[3634.96s -> 3639.92s]  Speaking of promotion, how was uh, how was being on the road for the chase?
[3640.56s -> 3644.24s]  Oh, it was fine. It was good. Well, I wasn't really on the road. I just went to the Arizona
[3644.24s -> 3648.48s]  shows. Okay, so you didn't go to like Denver. No, I just, I just went to Prescott. Obviously
[3648.48s -> 3653.76s]  I went to because it was like my showing and then the flag was like the first was like the
[3653.76s -> 3658.16s]  premiere of premieres. And then Phoenix was special too, because of Aerovita and everything.
[3658.16s -> 3661.12s]  So it was like the three I went to were kind of just the local ones.
[3662.08s -> 3669.26s]  It was fun. It was actually like, uh, you know, I've never been in a movie like that.
[3669.26s -> 3674.30s]  It's like, it's like an interesting experience to like go to a theater in
[3674.30s -> 3678.86s]  Phoenix and like, you know, or like the Orpheum and Flagstaff and like, um,
[3680.78s -> 3684.78s]  so I think getting to like hang out with those guys, like I feel like Jeff and I
[3684.78s -> 3689.98s]  actually like became like friends during that time period. Cause like we were always
[3689.98s -> 3696.14s]  acquaintances of course, you know, but like starting at the, the actual year of the running
[3696.14s -> 3703.26s]  of, of, of the race into the following year of like all the promotion and the media and the,
[3703.26s -> 3708.06s]  and then the film tour and stuff. I actually have a call later with Jeff today. You know,
[3708.06s -> 3713.66s]  it's like, uh, he's actually quote unquote, my coach, which is a whole entire,
[3713.66s -> 3717.58s]  another conversation, which is an interesting conversation. Um,
[3717.74s -> 3722.22s]  I can't see that. Well, that's the point. It's like, we both, I think, think it's funny,
[3722.94s -> 3728.54s]  but, but it's like, but it is funny. But it's like interval workout, but it's like
[3729.34s -> 3732.78s]  the, the thing with Jeff is like, I think people think it's like, sort of like this
[3732.78s -> 3737.10s]  like odd couple thing, like the people that know about it, but it's actually like,
[3737.74s -> 3741.34s]  or like even Jeff talks about, I think sometimes where it's like, he tells people,
[3741.34s -> 3744.70s]  he's like, cause he like comes to Prescott and we go running all the time, him and his wife,
[3745.66s -> 3749.90s]  him and generally like coming to Prescott. And it's like, so we go running all the time.
[3749.90s -> 3752.78s]  And like, he was saying like, people are always like, really like prestige. Like you're
[3752.78s -> 3756.62s]  going running with prestige. It's like, yeah, it's like, because I think that like,
[3756.62s -> 3760.62s]  there are a lot of like superficial things about Jeff and I that like don't click
[3760.62s -> 3765.18s]  in people's heads. But the thing about Jeff is he's like, he's incredibly intelligent.
[3765.18s -> 3769.90s]  He's incredibly thoughtful and he's incredibly kind. And it's like, what the fuck else
[3769.90s -> 3775.58s]  matters? It's like, it's like my wife, you meet my wife. My wife is not who anyone thinks that
[3775.58s -> 3781.02s]  like I would probably like the stereotypical person that pops in people's heads who thinks
[3781.02s -> 3785.74s]  that like I would be married to. She's not any of that. It's like, but she's like the
[3785.74s -> 3789.74s]  most thoughtful, kind, caring person I've ever met. And it's like, that's what matters.
[3790.38s -> 3793.50s]  So like the people like Jeff and I have a great relationship.
[3794.46s -> 3801.98s]  You know, it's like, does he like work out more than I do? Of course he does. It's like,
[3801.98s -> 3807.42s]  do I do speed work and like strength training with Jeff? Like, no, but we go running together
[3807.42s -> 3811.50s]  and like hang out and talk about like being, you know, talk about lots of stuff.
[3811.50s -> 3813.02s]  Has he changed your mind on anything?
[3814.38s -> 3819.18s]  Probably not. I don't know. That's not true. I mean, of course, like that that's the thing
[3819.18s -> 3823.98s]  too is like, you know, I come on here and I get like, I've been pounding coffee all day and I
[3823.98s -> 3830.22s]  get on these tangents and it's like, I'm not like super stubborn about any of this. It's like,
[3830.86s -> 3833.74s]  No, I'm asking because he's a different person. He's a different person.
[3833.74s -> 3838.94s]  Yeah. No, but again, I feel like about the things that matters, like he's,
[3838.94s -> 3846.22s]  we're pretty similar. Like he's like, he and I like beyond the, like the, you know,
[3846.22s -> 3848.70s]  because we've talked about that, you know, there's like, there's the
[3848.70s -> 3853.66s]  Versteeg image and then there's like the Bronco Billy character, right? That like people like
[3853.66s -> 3860.14s]  think whatever that is, I actually don't really know, but whatever that is. And it's like,
[3860.14s -> 3865.18s]  well, we're actually just like two guys with families, like trying to like navigate
[3866.06s -> 3868.54s]  like our kids' lives and like,
[3868.54s -> 3874.62s]  like carve because I mean, realistically, like he, he's similar. I mean, I think he's,
[3874.62s -> 3879.98s]  he's competitively speaking, like far more successful than I ever have been.
[3880.70s -> 3885.26s]  But the reality is that in very different ways, we've both sort of carved out these like
[3885.26s -> 3893.02s]  little spaces for ourselves in the sport, which are both very different, but are both like
[3893.10s -> 3901.98s]  this odd. Like I don't think he has like a traditional like at this point, you know,
[3903.42s -> 3906.86s]  maybe he did. I don't, I don't know. I don't, I don't, I'm not really good at that because I
[3906.86s -> 3912.14s]  don't follow people online, but- Are you, and I'm all over the place,
[3912.14s -> 3919.34s]  but are you, are you still, I shouldn't even say still, like in 2026,
[3919.90s -> 3925.50s]  do you still want to like be competitive at Cocodona? Is it, will it be, will it be one
[3925.50s -> 3930.86s]  of those years where you try hard? Well, I tried hard this year. I, I went in,
[3930.86s -> 3937.66s]  I went in this year the most fit I've ever been, like not even close, like not even close.
[3938.62s -> 3946.67s]  And that didn't work out. It's like, I thought this, I thought this year was like
[3946.75s -> 3954.11s]  the year that I was going to put it all together and be super fit and nail it and do it.
[3955.95s -> 3960.19s]  And I've trained more than I've ever trained for it. I've prepared more than I've ever
[3960.19s -> 3966.67s]  prepared for it. And I, you know, I didn't finish. It was a really freak weather year,
[3966.67s -> 3969.07s]  though. I mean- But I don't think that, I don't think I can
[3969.07s -> 3976.11s]  use that as an excuse. Like, I mean, I have my excuses. I certainly have my excuses.
[3976.75s -> 3982.99s]  I mean, really, really my, is sleep. For me, sleep is, I just, I can't sleep at the race.
[3982.99s -> 3987.23s]  Even the year of the film, I slept, the first time I slept successfully was at Mon's Park
[3988.35s -> 3993.23s]  and the morning of the third day. And I slept for 10 minutes and I took a five-minute trail
[3993.23s -> 4000.35s]  nap later that day. And it was like, and my third day fell apart. You can actually see,
[4000.35s -> 4004.67s]  I actually, after one of the film showings, we went and did this like long form podcast
[4004.67s -> 4009.55s]  with Jamil and Jeff and I. We just like talked for a few hours and they have this graph of like
[4009.55s -> 4016.51s]  the top five runners and all base, all it's all in, so like Jeff is like a hundred
[4017.79s -> 4025.71s]  and then it's everyone's pace for like that third day. And you can just see like Arlen,
[4025.71s -> 4033.79s]  like the guys, the guys who slept, you can see, you can see them like catching Jeff.
[4033.79s -> 4040.11s]  So like Arlen and Harry. And then at a certain point you see Joe and I. So Joe and I is like,
[4040.11s -> 4044.03s]  you can just literally, you can look at this graph and you can literally see it. It was like,
[4044.03s -> 4049.39s]  oh, right there. And Joe and I like fall off the map. It's like, cause Joe and I couldn't
[4049.39s -> 4055.07s]  sleep. We were like, we couldn't sleep the whole race. We both spent hours. I spent probably
[4055.07s -> 4064.35s]  like five hours that year trying to sleep unsuccessfully. And it's just like, so,
[4064.35s -> 4070.59s]  so this, so this year, the point was to not only go in super fit and ready for it,
[4070.59s -> 4076.75s]  but also like cut out the bullshit. Like the, and like, don't waste time at eight. And there's
[4076.75s -> 4082.19s]  25, I don't know how many aid stations there are at Coca-Cola. It's like 25 aid stations.
[4082.19s -> 4088.19s]  Like you spend 10 minutes at each aid station. That's four hours that you spend at aid station.
[4088.19s -> 4094.67s]  There's like, there's an amazing amount of fat to trim at coca-dona where it's like,
[4094.67s -> 4097.87s]  which is part of why it's so addictive. Cause you're like, Oh, I could do like,
[4097.87s -> 4101.79s]  if I do this, like one thing better, I can cut. It's not like a hundred miler where you're
[4101.79s -> 4104.43s]  like finished and you're like, Oh, I could have done this one thing better. And like
[4104.43s -> 4109.23s]  maybe finished like an hour faster. It's like, no, if I do this one thing better at
[4109.23s -> 4114.75s]  coca-dona, like I could finish like eight hours faster if I just like nail this one thing.
[4114.75s -> 4118.27s]  And that's part of why it's like, Oh, I want to go back and do it again and like try it.
[4118.27s -> 4127.55s]  But it's like, um, because there's so much non-moving time at coca-dona that
[4127.55s -> 4133.31s]  theoretically you can cut out, but realistically it's hard to cut that out,
[4134.67s -> 4137.71s]  which I found out this year. So that's what happened this year was like I came into
[4137.71s -> 4142.51s]  Sedona. I mean, everything was just so fast this year. It was crazy, but it didn't feel
[4142.51s -> 4147.47s]  stressful. It was just, it just was fast. But I was like that first and second day,
[4147.47s -> 4151.15s]  I was just like nailing things. Like I was in and out of aid stations. I was skipping aid
[4151.15s -> 4158.19s]  stations. I was like, I was like moving at my ideal pace through the whole, all the way,
[4158.19s -> 4162.43s]  basically, I mean, even at Sedona, that last stretch where I really started to fall apart,
[4162.43s -> 4168.19s]  I was really only like an hour behind, like my ideal pace, but it was still a few hours earlier
[4168.19s -> 4175.55s]  than even Jeff's time, like the previous year. And then all the same thing started to happen
[4175.55s -> 4180.11s]  as that first, as the year before, where I was like, I need to sleep. I can't sleep.
[4180.11s -> 4184.51s]  Things are snowballing. Now it's pouring rain again. And I'm starting to like,
[4184.51s -> 4190.51s]  my shadow is catching up to me from the previous year. And when my, when my shadow
[4190.51s -> 4196.27s]  caught up to me is when I lost all motivation. I was like, the entire point of this year was
[4196.27s -> 4202.43s]  to do better. And I spent a day and a half doing better and everything was going so well.
[4203.07s -> 4208.83s]  And then it, and then, and then it wasn't, and I didn't have the like mental fortitude or
[4208.83s -> 4216.03s]  ambition to like suck it up and do it because I felt like I was repeating everything
[4216.03s -> 4221.15s]  that happened the previous year, which the whole point of this year was to not do that.
[4222.83s -> 4225.71s]  And so I stopped and I couldn't sleep. If I, if I had slept,
[4226.91s -> 4231.39s]  if I had just fallen asleep, dude, that's what bothers me about this last year.
[4232.43s -> 4238.11s]  Like if I had just fallen asleep for an hour or half an hour, if I could just fall asleep,
[4239.23s -> 4244.91s]  like that's what, that's what nags me, especially waking up that next morning and
[4244.91s -> 4249.87s]  seeing how much those guys slowed down on that third day. I was like, if I,
[4249.87s -> 4254.43s]  if I was able to sleep in Sedona for an hour, and I know this is like super hypothetical,
[4254.43s -> 4259.07s]  like, but I was like, if I, if I was able to sleep for like an hour or a half an hour,
[4259.07s -> 4264.59s]  I was like, I think I could have maintained through that third day. And that's, that's
[4264.59s -> 4269.31s]  the part of me that drives me crazy. But again, I have these theoretical conversations
[4269.31s -> 4273.15s]  and I'm always like, well, what I found out for myself,
[4274.99s -> 4280.43s]  I have to sleep at coca-dona. I can't do it without sleep. I have to at least fall asleep.
[4280.43s -> 4285.39s]  It doesn't have to be a lot, but I can't do coca-dona without sleeping.
[4285.39s -> 4286.03s]  Yeah.
[4286.03s -> 4291.87s]  And I can't sleep at coca-dona. So what does that mean? Like I can't do coca-dona.
[4293.55s -> 4294.83s]  Like the way that I want to do it.
[4294.83s -> 4295.71s]  Where you want to do it.
[4296.11s -> 4304.43s]  In this way, in this running in 54 hours or whatever. It's like, it's, it's, and that's
[4304.43s -> 4308.83s]  okay. That, I mean, that was a conversation I had with Chad, who was my crew this year was like,
[4308.83s -> 4313.31s]  he's like, yeah, you might have to like, like, you might have to accept the fact that
[4313.31s -> 4317.31s]  the fastest you can run coca-dona is whatever I ran it.
[4317.31s -> 4319.71s]  In 23 or 22 or 21?
[4319.71s -> 4321.23s]  Or no, whatever year I ran.
[4321.23s -> 4322.03s]  Oh, the 65.
[4322.99s -> 4327.71s]  Like maybe that's as fast as you can run coca-dona because yes, you can point to all this time that
[4327.71s -> 4333.07s]  you're like not moving and wasting time, but maybe that's actually not wasted time.
[4333.07s -> 4340.51s]  Maybe a lot of that is like, that's what you need in order to run coca-dona.
[4340.51s -> 4346.51s]  And so it's like accepting the fact that like, maybe you can't do it the way that you
[4346.51s -> 4350.43s]  think or that you want to do it. Maybe you can do it the way that you can do it.
[4350.43s -> 4354.91s]  And the way that you can do it isn't like, so it's like, and that's all fine. That's
[4354.91s -> 4357.39s]  all, that's all fine. That's what's cool. I mean, we've talked about, I don't know.
[4357.39s -> 4362.83s]  You've talked about on other, like on other conversations you've had with people about
[4362.83s -> 4369.39s]  like, there's a part that's fun about being at that point. It's like running Western States,
[4369.95s -> 4374.19s]  you know, decades ago, there's like, there's something fun about being involved
[4374.27s -> 4382.35s]  in the sport at this like, at this point, because no one knows how to do coca-dona correctly.
[4383.47s -> 4387.31s]  And everyone's figuring it out and it'll be another few years until like people have really
[4387.31s -> 4393.23s]  figured it out. But it's like, it's fun to, because how many, like how many things in our
[4393.23s -> 4398.43s]  lives are we like involved in? I mean, this is you very much as well as me, like
[4398.51s -> 4406.27s]  your own experiences at coca-dona. So it's like, it's fun to be a part of that conversation
[4406.27s -> 4412.43s]  or that experiment, you know? It's again, if I'm thinking about misunderstandings for a second,
[4412.43s -> 4419.15s]  before we had this conversation, the one before, I see two camps of people in the sport.
[4419.15s -> 4425.31s]  I see people who are primarily attracted to like the, the can it even be done type projects.
[4425.31s -> 4429.63s]  And then there's the camp of people who are in like the, yes, it can be done,
[4429.63s -> 4434.03s]  how fast can I do it camp? And I would have totally put you in like the, I'm attracted
[4434.03s -> 4438.99s]  to stuff where it's like, it's uncertain if it can even be completed. And now here you are
[4438.99s -> 4443.79s]  talking about how cool it is to be engaged in like the optimization. Yeah, but I also
[4443.79s -> 4452.59s]  think that like, I'm probably, you know, I think, I think that I'm always constantly looking
[4452.59s -> 4460.75s]  for like new ways to express myself in, in the sport. Because this sport, for me,
[4460.75s -> 4468.19s]  there are other factors that like, keep me involved, you know, I mean, just like having
[4468.19s -> 4472.35s]  a relationship with brands and friends and like, it's, you know, it very much is my
[4474.03s -> 4479.31s]  job and my career at this point is being involved in the running community, similar to
[4479.31s -> 4487.95s]  you. You know what I mean? It's like, and so I do probably more than I would with other
[4488.59s -> 4497.07s]  pursuits. I do spend some energy and time exploring how to stay interested and how
[4497.07s -> 4503.55s]  to keep my motivation for these things. And honestly, like a lot of that on like,
[4504.51s -> 4511.63s]  uncharted territory for me is the sort of the traditional stuff.
[4513.07s -> 4518.67s]  You know, it's like having a coach with Jeff and like having to learn, learn what a fucking
[4518.67s -> 4523.79s]  like fartlek is, whatever, however you pronounce that, like not that I do them,
[4523.79s -> 4530.59s]  but I at least like know the word. And it's like, or like, dude, I don't know, like I'm,
[4530.59s -> 4540.59s]  I've trained, I've, not only am I running UTMB, I've, it's, it's not even close how much I've
[4540.59s -> 4546.43s]  trained for this race. I've never trained for a race like I've trained for UTMB. I've been
[4546.43s -> 4550.75s]  training since Cocodona, like hard. And it's like, it's because, but that's also like
[4550.75s -> 4555.63s]  personal life stuff is like, I've had, I've had a lot of iterations in like phases of my
[4556.43s -> 4560.91s]  running career over the past 15 years. And I've had phases where I've had sponsorships
[4560.91s -> 4565.63s]  and I've had phases where I've like prioritized running and those things have not always
[4565.63s -> 4574.11s]  overlapped. So like, I had a lot of things in my personal life close this year and,
[4574.11s -> 4579.87s]  and more time to like sort of select what I want to prioritize in my life.
[4580.83s -> 4589.63s]  And the reality is, is that like, there's not a lot of people in this world that have the
[4589.63s -> 4595.47s]  opportunity to prioritize something that they would be doing anyways, running around in the
[4595.47s -> 4605.55s]  mountains and have a wild amount of support from somebody. And it would, it feels like
[4606.43s -> 4612.59s]  the amount of support that I have from Satisfye and, and also coming into a time in my life where
[4612.59s -> 4617.71s]  I'm also able to prioritize it for the first time. Do I wish this happened when I was like
[4617.71s -> 4626.67s]  25, like maybe, and not 40, but like 40 is fine. It's like, like, and this is not to say
[4626.67s -> 4632.35s]  that I'm going to do like, I don't know what I honestly have no idea what I'm going to do
[4632.35s -> 4640.51s]  on Saturday. Like no idea. Because I've never been this fit, but I also don't race anymore.
[4640.51s -> 4644.59s]  Like I haven't like really raced in like the other, you take Cocodona and John Kappas,
[4644.59s -> 4649.55s]  like the two like least racy races out there, like out of the mix. Like I really
[4649.55s -> 4658.19s]  haven't raced a whole lot. So like, like in a lot of ways I'm like a wildly inexperienced
[4658.51s -> 4665.39s]  new runner because I'm like trained and fit and going. So anyway, I'm saying all of this just
[4665.39s -> 4675.07s]  to say that like, like that is unexplored territory for me. Whereas like, and maybe
[4675.07s -> 4680.75s]  that's like what everyone else's experience is, or maybe that's-
[4680.75s -> 4682.27s]  It's been their upbringing in the sport.
[4682.27s -> 4687.95s]  Yeah. But for me, it's like, it's an entirely new world. So it's like, and that right now
[4687.95s -> 4694.03s]  is holding my interest a little bit. You know what I mean? Like can I have the best race
[4694.03s -> 4699.95s]  in my life and get top 10 at UTMB? Is that a possibility? I don't think like, again,
[4699.95s -> 4705.39s]  I don't have like, I don't, I'm not, I don't think that I can win UTMB. Like I don't think
[4705.39s -> 4712.70s]  any of that, but I think that like, how long can I keep up with Courtney? You know,
[4712.70s -> 4715.66s]  or like last year, like Katie got 11th or something like that.
[4715.66s -> 4718.30s]  And how good are you through inclement weather and the night?
[4718.30s -> 4722.46s]  That's another thing too, is like, like I don't think I've always said my entire
[4722.46s -> 4728.06s]  running career is that like, I don't care like how much I ever trained in my life
[4728.62s -> 4732.14s]  and how much I prioritize it. And I had the best run of my life.
[4732.14s -> 4735.90s]  I would never be competitive at like Western States or something like that.
[4735.90s -> 4741.50s]  But I've always said UTMB and hard rock. If I get a shot, those were like the two races
[4741.50s -> 4745.50s]  that I always thought that I would be competitive. And you throw on top of that,
[4745.50s -> 4750.78s]  that the worse the conditions are, the better I do competitively speaking.
[4751.90s -> 4757.18s]  So like you're a survivor, like a rainy, super cold UTMB, like I think I can do pretty well.
[4758.62s -> 4762.14s]  Now, again, I'm, but I'm also not obsessed with it. I also like don't
[4762.14s -> 4767.98s]  like, and this is part of what I think makes me not a great runner is like,
[4770.06s -> 4775.18s]  we talked about this last time about like the really good athletes in the world are not like
[4775.18s -> 4780.46s]  balanced people. They're not like balanced, healthy, mentally stable people.
[4780.46s -> 4783.90s]  And I would say that, I mean, I don't want to, you know, talk shit about
[4783.90s -> 4787.66s]  people that I'm going to be running with on Saturday, but it's like,
[4787.66s -> 4790.70s]  which I'm not talking shit, but it's like, it's just like you have,
[4790.70s -> 4796.22s]  there's a part of you that has to be unbalanced, in my opinion, to do super
[4796.22s -> 4801.90s]  well at anything. So it's like, so, and that's the thing is like, I want to do the
[4801.90s -> 4807.50s]  best that I can. And I will do the best that I can. Absolutely. But, but like,
[4810.38s -> 4814.62s]  I don't have as much pressure on me as those other guys do. Or I don't have,
[4815.66s -> 4820.46s]  my career in this sport is not tied to getting top 10 at UTMB or anything.
[4822.22s -> 4825.50s]  But I think because of that, I have a lot of excuses, you know, it's like,
[4825.50s -> 4830.62s]  oh, I had to sleep in the fucking laundry room. Like if you guys had just gotten me a good
[4830.62s -> 4837.70s]  place, I would have, I would have podiumed. But it's like, yeah, but, but again,
[4838.42s -> 4843.94s]  just to jump back to like, that is what's kind of holding my attention right now.
[4845.22s -> 4852.42s]  Dude, I ran on a fucking treadmill. Wow. Like, yeah, that's the story too.
[4853.78s -> 4855.94s]  So it's just like, it's just like all these things that are like,
[4856.18s -> 4862.74s]  uh, where was the treadmill? Well, so Prescott, so the month, the, for those that don't know,
[4862.74s -> 4867.78s]  the Southwest gets like half of its precipitation in like the summer months,
[4868.50s -> 4873.54s]  like during the monsoon seasons. Uh, so like July and August in the afternoon,
[4873.54s -> 4877.86s]  storms roll in, temperatures cool down and it rains. That just didn't happen this year.
[4878.74s -> 4882.34s]  So it was like a crazy heat wave. It was way too hot in Prescott.
[4883.30s -> 4890.90s]  So like basically since Tushars till now, there wasn't a single day where I felt like I could go
[4890.90s -> 4896.18s]  out and train and run. So I was either doing night, like hill repeats. We have this,
[4896.18s -> 4903.62s]  we have this trail in Prescott. It's like 20% grade of just like doing repeats of that.
[4904.66s -> 4909.86s]  Or, um, what ended up happening because even that was hard. It's like we put the,
[4909.86s -> 4914.90s]  we put the baby to sleep. It's like, we like, it's like nine, 10 o'clock at night. And I have
[4914.90s -> 4921.38s]  to like get my shoes on and go like load into the truck and like drive to the trail. It's
[4921.38s -> 4925.46s]  just like, that's hard, you know, doing that at like, cause I'm tired, you know, I'm tired.
[4925.46s -> 4929.94s]  And it's like, so we, anyways, we found a treadmill. I can't believe I'm telling the
[4929.94s -> 4935.86s]  story. This is going to ruin my image. Uh, it's like the, we found a treadmill that does
[4935.86s -> 4941.22s]  like 15%, you know, and I just like hung an air conditioning unit in front of it and like
[4941.78s -> 4947.78s]  a television. And I would just watch a Vikings and like just do uphill and do like 3000 feet
[4947.78s -> 4956.26s]  an hour and just climb. Damn, like just climb at 15% at like four and a half miles per hour,
[4956.26s -> 4962.45s]  just for as long as I could stand it. And that was like the last two weeks of my training
[4962.45s -> 4966.29s]  because it was, I could, I couldn't figure out any other thing that like worked,
[4967.01s -> 4971.17s]  but that was also, I mean, that's part of my life, like not prioritizing it enough,
[4971.17s -> 4982.80s]  like, um, and not living in a place where I can train effectively in my opinion, which people
[4982.80s -> 4986.56s]  like, especially I'm sure there's like lots of people in Arizona, like rolling their eyes
[4986.56s -> 4990.32s]  about, Oh, you live in Prescott. It's like a place. A lot of people go to trail run,
[4990.32s -> 4995.36s]  you know, but it's like, but there wasn't anything like steep enough for like UTMB
[4995.36s -> 5001.60s]  training. So that was what was good about like, uh, doing John Kappas and then like staying up in
[5001.60s -> 5008.24s]  Silverton for like, like pay, I paced a pastry mill for like 10 hours at hard rock and then
[5008.24s -> 5013.68s]  just like climbing mountains every day leading into Tushers, you know, like that was all
[5013.68s -> 5017.68s]  that, like the summer as a whole was a really good training block for like doing all of that.
[5017.68s -> 5022.00s]  But the, for people that don't know what's John Kappas, cause I didn't want to assume
[5022.00s -> 5028.56s]  anything. Yeah, it's just, it's, um, initially started by, well, I don't know who it was
[5028.56s -> 5033.20s]  started by, but I know it was like sort of resurrected by James Varner rain shadow running.
[5033.20s -> 5037.92s]  So there was just like, there's always, as everyone who's ever been to hard rock knows,
[5037.92s -> 5041.76s]  there's a lot of people that sort of linger in Silverton for the couple of weeks before
[5041.76s -> 5047.92s]  after hard rock. And it was sort of just this glorified group run of, for, for those of us
[5047.92s -> 5056.16s]  who were like in Silverton that first year and, um, the, but essentially it's like a
[5056.16s -> 5062.48s]  marathon to 50 K course with like, you know, anywhere from like 18 to 19 to 20,000
[5062.48s -> 5067.20s]  feet of climbing, depending on the course. So like, yeah, almost 20,000 feet of climbing
[5067.20s -> 5072.32s]  and like a trail marathon. So you're just off trail the entire time that there are seven
[5072.96s -> 5080.32s]  the traditional course was like, there are seven, like 13 or ish type mountains around
[5080.32s -> 5084.48s]  downtown. And you just go up and down the most direct route of all of those mountains.
[5085.28s -> 5090.24s]  So that first year it was taking us like, you know, I don't know, I think that first year I
[5090.24s -> 5094.56s]  finished in like 16 hours or something like that, which I remember us saying at the time
[5094.56s -> 5101.84s]  had what was like probably a world record for like slowest winning 50 K time. You know,
[5101.84s -> 5109.76s]  it's like, uh, but, so it's just a fun, it's just a fun, and it still is, I mean, it's like,
[5109.76s -> 5115.20s]  uh, Ginny and Eric from Urey took over this year. Um, they do some other events in like
[5115.20s -> 5121.04s]  the Urey Silverton area and, uh, the sky pilots, I think is like their little organization
[5121.04s -> 5125.12s]  or whatever, but they took over, James stopped doing it. He did it in the first few years.
[5125.12s -> 5129.12s]  And then Ginny and Eric took over. Um, and they've actually, it's like this year was like
[5129.12s -> 5133.76s]  a totally different course. It was a low snow year. So we were able to do some things that we
[5133.76s -> 5137.12s]  can't do some other years. And it was actually, I think a little bit harder,
[5137.12s -> 5144.00s]  way more technical of a course, but just fun, like mountain scrambling, like most similar,
[5144.64s -> 5148.72s]  like most people don't finish it. And most people don't have the intention of finishing
[5148.72s -> 5155.60s]  it. It's free. It's like, I, I, yeah, you know, there were 50 people this year,
[5155.60s -> 5159.68s]  which like typically there's like, I think the year before there were like 20 of us, you know,
[5159.68s -> 5164.96s]  it's like probably not great that all of, if all of your listeners run out and like try
[5165.68s -> 5169.60s]  sign up for this race, but it's just a glorified, yeah, it's just a glorified group
[5169.60s -> 5175.76s]  run on some like gnarly terrain with aid stations. So the San Juans are notoriously
[5175.76s -> 5180.56s]  difficult to get permits for races because you're, you go through the entire San Juan
[5180.56s -> 5187.04s]  mountains are kind of a patchwork of like private land, private, private property,
[5187.04s -> 5192.80s]  private mines, BLM national forest, all that stuff. So like that's actually, I think somebody
[5192.80s -> 5196.96s]  told me once that about like Hard Rock, like if Hard Rock ever lost its permit, it wouldn't be
[5196.96s -> 5201.28s]  renewed because it's like, like if you tried to have Hard Rock today, you wouldn't be able
[5201.28s -> 5206.88s]  to permit it. So it's like, so, so that's another reason why John Capps, like they,
[5206.88s -> 5211.92s]  they keep it at like 40, 50 people because anything over 75, you have to have a permit.
[5213.36s -> 5216.32s]  I don't know if you know the answer to this question and I've only been to Hard Rock a
[5216.32s -> 5222.32s]  few times or the San Juans a few times, but like in my experience there, it's amazing to
[5222.32s -> 5227.04s]  me if, and you don't even have to look that closely how much of a junkyard it is for all
[5227.04s -> 5233.81s]  this old mining equipment. Like how did that, like when these companies leave those mountains,
[5234.45s -> 5237.73s]  where is the responsibility to pull that stuff out? Like how are they allowed to just
[5237.73s -> 5246.85s]  keep it open? A lot of modern mines, what they do is they keep the mines technically open.
[5247.73s -> 5254.37s]  So there's like a huge mine outside of Ajo by the Mexican border in Arizona that like
[5255.89s -> 5261.25s]  they keep like a skeleton staff there. It's like cheaper to keep like a skeleton staff
[5261.25s -> 5267.17s]  there employed there and to technically keep the mine open. So you never have to
[5268.21s -> 5272.61s]  clean it up basically. And that's not the case with a lot of the San Juans stuff,
[5272.61s -> 5276.77s]  but I think that there are like, there are techniques like that. I think the San Juans are
[5276.77s -> 5289.10s]  just so, I mean, it's, I think a lot of that is just left over from eras where you didn't
[5289.10s -> 5294.06s]  have to clean anything up. That's amazing. Would be my assumption is like, you know,
[5295.34s -> 5300.62s]  early 20th century type stuff. But those mines, it's sort of like being in Chamonix
[5300.62s -> 5303.66s]  or something where like in a completely different way where it's like,
[5305.42s -> 5312.70s]  you know, if I'm out in the mountains in like Silverton or something, and I like run up
[5312.70s -> 5315.82s]  engineer mountain or something, which is like one of the more popular mountains in the area.
[5315.82s -> 5319.50s]  And I like see a bunch of people at like, you sort of get in your head, it's like,
[5319.50s -> 5321.90s]  God, there's a lot of people here. You know what I mean? It's like,
[5322.46s -> 5325.34s]  like what's going on? Like, why are there so many people? And it's like,
[5325.34s -> 5332.32s]  but when you're in Chamonix, it's just like every 30 seconds is like, you know,
[5332.32s -> 5335.76s]  Bonjour, Bonjour. It's actually the most annoying thing of like how many times you have to say
[5335.76s -> 5338.72s]  Bonjour to people while you're like running around the mountains here. And it's like,
[5338.72s -> 5342.08s]  but because there's so many people, like, it doesn't bother me as much.
[5343.04s -> 5348.24s]  Yeah, it's like, it's like Yosemite or something. It's like, it's just how it is.
[5348.24s -> 5352.08s]  It's the Grand Canyon. It's the corridor trails on the Grand Canyon. It's just how it is.
[5352.72s -> 5358.40s]  And it's like, um, the San Juan's, I feel like are similar in that sense of like,
[5358.40s -> 5364.00s]  like in any other mountain range, if there was like, like a messy mine,
[5365.36s -> 5368.88s]  it'd be like, God, they need to clean that thing up. But the San Juan's, it's like, oh,
[5368.88s -> 5372.88s]  that's like these entire mountains are like that. So it doesn't bother me as much. It's
[5372.88s -> 5377.92s]  just part of the character of those mountains is to be like completely fucking destroyed.
[5378.48s -> 5382.00s]  Or like you come to a creek and you like take a sip of the water and it like,
[5382.72s -> 5390.00s]  it like is the worst saltiest taste you've ever experienced in your life. And it's like,
[5391.52s -> 5393.76s]  like, that's just like part of the San Juan's is like,
[5395.44s -> 5400.40s]  from an ecological standpoint is like, they're kind of ruined. And it's like, it's fine.
[5401.68s -> 5406.88s]  I don't know. It like bothers me less than like, than other places, just because it's
[5406.88s -> 5411.68s]  like, it's past, it's irredeemable. I think you just said it's like, it's past the point of like,
[5412.24s -> 5414.40s]  so it becomes a part of it. And it becomes like,
[5416.08s -> 5421.20s]  the ATV is driving, bother me a lot in San Juan's than the, than the mines do.
[5421.20s -> 5427.84s]  But I mean, I don't know a ton about engineering, but I will say it is impressive
[5427.84s -> 5430.96s]  to see the placement of some of those mines too, like what they were able to
[5431.92s -> 5435.60s]  lug up those mountains and station things where they did. Pretty amazing.
[5436.56s -> 5440.64s]  Completely. Yeah. Like how did you do that in the 1870s or whatever? I mean, for those that
[5440.64s -> 5444.56s]  haven't like run in the San Juan's, I mean, you come across these sites,
[5444.56s -> 5447.84s]  like you'll be out running all day and you at the top of these mountains and like,
[5447.84s -> 5454.24s]  you come across and it's like, how the fuck did those guys like, holy, it's so crazy.
[5455.44s -> 5466.85s]  Yeah. Yeah. We've had this fairly recent ongoing conversation on the podcast just about
[5466.85s -> 5471.65s]  public lands and the wilderness debate. I actually, we just had Anton in studio like
[5472.29s -> 5476.29s]  two hours before you got here and I gifted him this book, which is just like an anthology
[5476.85s -> 5481.65s]  of all of the sort of back and forth pros and cons of wilderness and American society. Like
[5481.65s -> 5485.25s]  I would, if he hadn't taken it, I would have given it to you. I'm sure you've read all of
[5485.25s -> 5493.73s]  it. I mean, it spans like stuff from like, anyways, there's just a lot to it. And I mean,
[5493.73s -> 5497.09s]  for example, I didn't prepare for this episode. I didn't realize that you spent like
[5497.89s -> 5502.05s]  two months in Bears Ears, like immerse yourself in that, but when you were doing the field guide
[5502.05s -> 5506.93s]  thing, like you like immersed yourself in it. Yeah. I mean, we were living in those,
[5506.93s -> 5512.53s]  basically living in the canyons for months. And then that segue the next year, we did the
[5512.53s -> 5520.69s]  same thing, grand staircase, which I think Morgan, the lady that I co-wrote the, well,
[5521.49s -> 5526.05s]  no, I shouldn't say that. The Bears Ears ones, I think Morgan spent a lot more time in Bears Ears
[5526.05s -> 5532.13s]  than I did. But then we both ended up living in, like we were living in Escalante,
[5533.01s -> 5537.49s]  spent a lot of times in grand staircase. So yeah, that was like a pretty long period of
[5540.34s -> 5546.37s]  my life. Just being in that part of the country, especially at that time,
[5546.37s -> 5550.61s]  like it was just an interesting, I mean, obviously it was an interesting time to be there,
[5550.69s -> 5555.01s]  you know, with all the public land debate going on. And
[5557.65s -> 5564.45s]  it's not often that like public land policy becomes like a conversation piece for people
[5564.45s -> 5570.21s]  on like a national level or like a, so it was like, yeah. Why did this break through?
[5572.46s -> 5577.34s]  Like for me personally? No, no, no. Like what was it about this particular instance
[5577.34s -> 5582.86s]  where the conversation became national? Obama set aside a national monument and then
[5582.86s -> 5590.94s]  Trump rescinded it and then, but it was also, it was also the Obama, the Obama using the
[5590.94s -> 5599.74s]  national monument strategy to set aside. So typically national, so a little bit on
[5599.74s -> 5607.98s]  like public land stuff is that national parks need an act of Congress to set it aside. So
[5610.06s -> 5616.06s]  so using the national monument, typically, historically national monuments have been set
[5616.06s -> 5620.62s]  aside to like, this is like Abraham Lincoln's cabin or something, you know, like these like
[5620.62s -> 5626.78s]  little sites that are like historical or something that can be set aside as a national monument.
[5627.42s -> 5632.38s]  But in the fine, in the fine print, there's really nothing that says that it has to be
[5632.38s -> 5647.70s]  that. So the Bears Ears thing was unique because having a, having a president that was like
[5647.70s -> 5652.90s]  sympathetic towards not only public lands, but towards like indigenous tribes of that entire
[5652.90s -> 5657.86s]  area and was willing to listen to that and also like protect quote unquote, protect these
[5657.86s -> 5663.14s]  lands. And we can, we can take the quotes off that protect later in this conversation if
[5663.14s -> 5671.62s]  we want to. But to set aside at least under the guise of a form of protection
[5673.46s -> 5678.90s]  for a huge swath of land, as big as a national park, bigger than a lot of national parks,
[5678.90s -> 5682.34s]  that you don't need an act of Congress to do that. The president can just sign that.
[5682.90s -> 5687.06s]  So that was a move mostly by the conservation groups of the area and of like,
[5687.06s -> 5693.62s]  you know, bigger national conservation groups to try and push that through that didn't require
[5694.66s -> 5699.30s]  an act of Congress to set it aside as a national park. But it had never been used that way before.
[5699.30s -> 5705.06s]  So that created a lot of controversy. And then obviously just with like the whole like,
[5705.06s -> 5710.10s]  you know, you know, we're experiencing now with Joe Biden where like Trump just wants to undo
[5710.10s -> 5714.26s]  regardless of it's good or bad, just undo whatever they did, right? Whatever the enemy
[5714.26s -> 5718.58s]  did just undo it. And it's like, so there was a lot of back and forth there. And there was a
[5718.58s -> 5723.38s]  lot of back and forth conversations like with the, you know, a lot of a lot of people in
[5723.38s -> 5728.42s]  that part of the country are very conservative, like Mormon families, and they like, they don't,
[5728.42s -> 5734.58s]  like, so it got turned into this thing, it got turned into this thing that it shouldn't
[5734.58s -> 5743.57s]  have got turned into, because it was just like, yeah, it became another thing for
[5743.57s -> 5748.13s]  depending on what side of the aisle you fell on that you were either pro or against didn't
[5748.13s -> 5752.77s]  have anything to do about what was actually going on there, or it wouldn't like disrupted
[5752.77s -> 5759.17s]  lifestyles or economics down there. If any, yeah, I mean, I mean, the only the the only
[5759.17s -> 5764.85s]  disruption to economics that it that it could have disrupted was potentially positive for
[5764.85s -> 5771.65s]  local economies. But that got turned into a thing too, whereas like the people in
[5771.65s -> 5776.77s]  Blanding and Monticello were like, oh, we don't like we don't want another Moab down here. And
[5776.77s -> 5781.65s]  it's like, well, that wouldn't have happened. But I mean, there are a lot of things that Moab
[5781.65s -> 5791.50s]  has that like Blanding Utah doesn't have, you know, but it's like the Yeah, just got,
[5791.50s -> 5796.06s]  you know, I got turned into this is just whatever, just another non issue for people
[5796.06s -> 5800.46s]  to disagree on, you know, it just got turned into that. And especially for like locals,
[5800.46s -> 5806.14s]  because it was like, you know, in their backyard to use and, you know, a purposeful.
[5807.50s -> 5810.86s]  Were you getting were you getting pretty involved in the politics of it?
[5810.86s -> 5814.14s]  Or were you just a little bit and then well, another reason why too is like,
[5814.14s -> 5818.14s]  because like Patagonia got involved, right? So like Patagonia is releasing images of like
[5818.14s -> 5822.54s]  oil rigs and Indian Creek, like climbers, like climbing next to oil rigs. And it's like,
[5822.54s -> 5828.38s]  well, that's just as misleading as like anything like Trump said about bears. So it's
[5828.38s -> 5832.06s]  just like, there was just a lot, there's just like anything you get into, you get into like
[5832.06s -> 5837.02s]  the nitty gritties of it. And it's like, like, there was this whole thing that that,
[5837.02s -> 5840.86s]  like, when Trump rescinded Bears Ears, and like, they were going to allow mining
[5840.86s -> 5845.02s]  and Bears Ears again. So there was like, there was this article released in like,
[5845.02s -> 5850.22s]  the New York Times is some about something about how, like, like, there's like going to be a
[5850.22s -> 5855.50s]  second, like not gold rush, but like uranium rush and Bears Ears and how all these people
[5855.50s -> 5861.82s]  and like, when he rescinded Bears Ears, there were that following like month, there were only
[5861.82s -> 5867.98s]  like two new mine claims made in that following months. And one of them was me and Morgan,
[5868.70s -> 5873.66s]  just because I wanted to learn about the mining. Like, I wanted to learn about how to
[5873.66s -> 5879.50s]  actually because people talk about like, file, like filing mining claims is actually like a bit,
[5879.50s -> 5884.38s]  it's actually a technique some conservation companies have considered, because it's pretty
[5884.38s -> 5890.62s]  cheap to file legal mining claims, sit on it. But that's the thing too, is like, you can't sit on
[5890.62s -> 5895.34s]  so this is a big public land conversation, you can't sit on things. So like mining claims
[5895.34s -> 5899.82s]  and cattle leases are the same cattle grazing leases are the same thing. So like, that's
[5899.82s -> 5904.86s]  actually a technique that like, Friends of Grand Staircase and and like Southern Utah
[5905.58s -> 5911.98s]  Conservation Wilderness Alliance, they like you can buy these cattle leases from
[5911.98s -> 5918.06s]  ranchers that are willing to sell them. But the BLM enforces that you run cattle. So now like SUA
[5918.06s -> 5923.02s]  and these other conservation companies had to go out and get cows. And now they're like in
[5923.02s -> 5929.66s]  the cattle industry because you have to run cows on the land. Anyways, same with mining,
[5929.66s -> 5938.54s]  you have to show periodically that you're investigating or it's like pretty minimal,
[5938.54s -> 5943.66s]  but you do have to like show that you're like, you're showing improvements on the land in some
[5943.66s -> 5950.62s]  way, which goes into a large larger conversation about public lands in general about like the
[5950.62s -> 5955.58s]  multi use policy and like there's a lot of misunderstandings about what multi use means
[5955.58s -> 5968.14s]  or like what it what its intent is. But none of those multi use ideas involve sitting on it.
[5968.86s -> 5974.46s]  Because sitting on it is wilderness. And if something's not designated wilderness or
[5974.46s -> 5981.82s]  designated wilderness study area. Yeah. The word conservation does not mean conservation
[5981.82s -> 5986.22s]  of wilderness. It means conservation of resources and conservation of resources
[5986.22s -> 5992.38s]  is exploitive. And it and it it's it's it's Is it responsibly exploitive?
[5992.62s -> 5998.54s]  It's supposed it's supposed to be okay. But what but even when you go back 100 years to like
[5998.54s -> 6003.58s]  Teddy Roosevelt went like went like like that word conservation has been adopted by like
[6003.58s -> 6009.74s]  biologists and by preservationists. But that word initially did not mean a preservation of
[6009.74s -> 6015.98s]  wilderness and meant it meant a conservation of resources. So of timber, coal, water. So
[6015.98s -> 6018.86s]  when people like John Wesley Powell and Theodore Roosevelt are using the word
[6019.34s -> 6023.50s]  conservation, like when John Wesley Powell is talking about the conservation of water,
[6023.50s -> 6027.42s]  he's talking about the utilization of water for human exploitation.
[6028.94s -> 6036.30s]  Or just human use, I guess, which can be good or bad or whatever. It doesn't matter
[6036.30s -> 6041.66s]  if it's good or bad. It's like but that's a thing that exists is like National Forest
[6041.66s -> 6049.34s]  and BLMs are not preservation societies. They're conservation institutions. And their goal
[6049.34s -> 6056.22s]  is to conserve resources, not wilderness, not nature. You can set then so this is this was
[6056.22s -> 6061.02s]  part of you know, you talking about Wally Stegner earlier. Yeah, this is part of why
[6061.02s -> 6067.26s]  there was a whole second revolution in in conservation or wilderness protection was because
[6067.26s -> 6074.14s]  the original like national parks and things that were set aside, what they thought was going
[6074.14s -> 6079.02s]  to be the wilderness like national parks were supposed to be the wilderness. But what they
[6079.02s -> 6087.74s]  found out was that if you don't also protect wilderness areas from development and tourism,
[6089.02s -> 6095.10s]  that and basically capitalism, if you don't if you don't if you don't protect these
[6095.10s -> 6101.82s]  area from capitalism, that they be in a lot of ways can become worse than the National Forest.
[6101.82s -> 6105.26s]  Like I don't think there's anyone that goes to Yosemite Valley and is like this wilderness
[6105.26s -> 6109.58s]  is amazing. It's like that is not I mean, there are areas around Yosemite that are incredible
[6109.58s -> 6114.14s]  but it's like or the Grand Canyon or something like that. So in the 50s and 60s, there was a
[6114.14s -> 6122.22s]  new movement that the Sierra Club and individuals and other other groups like you needed a whole
[6122.22s -> 6127.34s]  second wave of preservation and that was really the wilderness movement of the 50s and 60s
[6127.34s -> 6134.06s]  and Wally Stegner. So beyond the 100th meridian, John Wesley Powell was all of his
[6135.26s -> 6142.30s]  research and exploration was talking about water development west of the 100th meridian,
[6143.58s -> 6150.86s]  which is a line that run. It's basically the longitudinal line that runs north to south
[6150.86s -> 6158.22s]  through the United States that separates where agriculture receives enough rain
[6158.78s -> 6165.98s]  to support agriculture. I'm not saying this well. There's east of the 100th meridian,
[6165.98s -> 6171.90s]  it rains enough that you don't have to irrigate. West of the 100th meridian requires
[6171.90s -> 6178.38s]  supplemental water to have agriculture. So that's what that line is. And so John Wesley's
[6178.38s -> 6189.34s]  Powell entire research was about developing water to use both for agriculture but also just
[6189.34s -> 6197.58s]  residential and just like people living in arid country. So what Wally Stegner was all about
[6197.58s -> 6202.62s]  like moving beyond that 100th meridian and like what do we do in like the current sort
[6202.62s -> 6206.78s]  of like world? Anyways, that's sort of a segue or a tangent of a conversation.
[6214.06s -> 6218.62s]  And so the wilderness movement was essentially for that. Like we also need to protect
[6218.62s -> 6226.46s]  lands from tourism essentially and from high impact tourism, I should say.
[6227.42s -> 6238.22s]  So like the two sions of the world, like the Yosemite Valley of the world. And so it's like
[6238.22s -> 6251.98s]  we need to set aside that does not prioritize human experience in these areas. And the
[6252.06s -> 6258.14s]  national parks have shown that they're not able to do that. So they move towards this idea of
[6258.14s -> 6263.90s]  wilderness. Now the reason why national parks can, and this is to jump back to like the
[6263.90s -> 6269.74s]  Bears Ears and like looping into the Bears Ears Grand Staircase Escalante is a lot of
[6269.74s -> 6275.42s]  national parks are wilderness areas. So not only do they have national park status,
[6275.42s -> 6280.14s]  but they also have wilderness status. And the wilderness status is what gives more protection
[6280.14s -> 6286.54s]  to a land than the national park status does. So when you jump to something like Bears Ears,
[6287.66s -> 6296.14s]  there's a huge amount of that land that's already wilderness area that has more protection
[6296.14s -> 6305.50s]  on it than even the national monument status gave it. So it was really easy to like include
[6305.50s -> 6310.06s]  this wilderness area and include this wilderness area and include this wilderness area.
[6310.06s -> 6315.18s]  And you get this number of like these millions of acres that's being adopted into this national
[6315.18s -> 6322.22s]  monument. And it's like, when you actually look at the amount of land that was going to
[6322.22s -> 6329.26s]  receive more protection by the national monument, it's a very small percentage.
[6329.26s -> 6333.42s]  And I don't want to give any numbers because I would be making them up because I don't know
[6333.42s -> 6339.10s]  off the top of my head, but we actually sat down once and calculated the number of acres
[6339.10s -> 6346.94s]  that are again receiving more protections from the national monument than less. So basically it
[6346.94s -> 6353.90s]  would be ineffective for it to be a national monument. It's a really small percentage of
[6353.90s -> 6362.14s]  the overall percentage of what Bears Ears is. And the issue with that is like, is it worth
[6362.14s -> 6370.03s]  it? The conversation about that, is it worth it for this relatively small amount of acreage
[6370.75s -> 6377.31s]  to be set aside as a national monument when national monuments and national parks
[6377.31s -> 6386.99s]  as a whole have a policy of integrating and incorporating and supporting high impact tourism?
[6386.99s -> 6395.07s]  So is it worth it to set aside this small amount of land to have a national monument that now
[6395.87s -> 6400.75s]  the RVers are interested in because it has that word.
[6402.27s -> 6406.19s]  Now they're interested in coming. And once they start coming, then the BLM and the
[6406.19s -> 6409.87s]  national forests feel like, oh, well, we need to start building more parking lots. We need
[6409.87s -> 6413.31s]  to start building more bathrooms. We need to start building. We need to build more
[6413.39s -> 6420.19s]  exhibits. We need to, well, we're going to need more hotel. There's more people coming.
[6420.19s -> 6424.91s]  It starts this snowball effect of like, is that worth it to protect this relatively small
[6424.91s -> 6431.31s]  amount of land? Bears Ears is a really great example of like, it's not always good to just
[6431.31s -> 6438.67s]  set aside things as national parks. Typically the people that, I don't want to get too
[6439.07s -> 6447.55s]  red or blue here or anything on your podcast, but typically it's Republicans who are in support
[6447.55s -> 6453.47s]  of national parks because national parks don't typically, usually what national parks do is
[6453.47s -> 6458.19s]  they take existing wilderness areas, which already have more protections than a national
[6458.19s -> 6463.71s]  park. I know I'm repeating myself a lot, but they take conglomerates of wilderness areas
[6463.71s -> 6469.23s]  and they call it a national park because it allows economics. It allows capitalism in
[6469.23s -> 6475.47s]  the door. So you can now develop this area into a national park where you can have hotels,
[6475.47s -> 6480.27s]  restaurants, and theme parks. They've been trying to do it to the Grand Canyon forever.
[6480.27s -> 6483.63s]  It's like they've been trying to develop the Canyon, which is actually happening right now
[6483.63s -> 6487.39s]  on the reservation because they can't do it in other parts. So they're going to the
[6487.39s -> 6495.07s]  reservation right now. No, like the LCR gorge. So like places like that, places along Horseshoe
[6495.07s -> 6499.39s]  Bend outside of Page. So from like Horseshoe basically all along Marble Canyon from Page,
[6499.39s -> 6504.99s]  basically anything south of Glen Canyon Dam all the way to where the reservation ends,
[6504.99s -> 6510.83s]  which is like basically the LCR gorge where it meets the greater Colorado River.
[6512.19s -> 6515.55s]  So I mean, when I ran the Arizona trail, it was like I fundraised for Save the
[6515.55s -> 6519.07s]  Confluence. I mean you drive around Flagstaff and they're still like Save the Confluence
[6519.07s -> 6522.99s]  stickers. It's like if you go on a river trip, it's like talking point number one is like
[6522.99s -> 6527.63s]  development of the LCR gorge. So it's like, but that's because it's on the reservation.
[6527.63s -> 6533.39s]  They don't have the same public land stuff. So like all the big developers, they've been
[6533.39s -> 6538.67s]  thwarted at every chance that they get about developing the south or the north rim because
[6538.67s -> 6544.67s]  of conservation societies. So they're moving to the reservation now because it's easier
[6544.67s -> 6547.47s]  because they don't have the same loopholes to jump through.
[6549.47s -> 6553.47s]  I want to ask you like a very, I want to ask you a pretty large philosophical question.
[6553.47s -> 6557.31s]  Do you feel like, and this is more pertaining to like the value of wilderness,
[6557.31s -> 6561.55s]  do you feel like we've reached, maybe you could call it like a point of no return,
[6561.55s -> 6566.91s]  but do you feel like we've reached this point in society where what we've built is
[6566.91s -> 6574.27s]  so impossible to undo that the answer for the foreseeable future is to have a planet where
[6574.99s -> 6581.71s]  a certain percentage of it is like urban sprawl in civilization and a certain percentage of it is
[6581.71s -> 6588.19s]  just like remove human involvement as much as possible. Like coexistence can't be the mission.
[6588.19s -> 6593.95s]  It has to be like these like undisturbed from a human standpoint, tracks of land.
[6595.71s -> 6602.27s]  I just, the whole problem with the conservation movement in general is that
[6602.27s -> 6610.35s]  it's an ethical one. That's the biggest hurdle the conservation movement has in general is that
[6611.31s -> 6616.35s]  it's just you and I sitting here talking, deciding that that needs to exist.
[6617.71s -> 6622.67s]  There's no real, I mean, you can appeal as a conservationist and as conservation groups do
[6623.55s -> 6628.67s]  because you have to appeal like to different blocks and to different groups and to different
[6628.67s -> 6633.39s]  like. So if you want to go, if you want to go economics about what, like if you're appealing
[6633.39s -> 6640.19s]  to some business or to some, you know, big corporation about why conservation needs to exist,
[6640.19s -> 6644.83s]  then you need to talk economics. You need, you have to talk about the economics about
[6644.83s -> 6647.95s]  of why it's good to have wilderness areas. Like you can appeal to that.
[6648.91s -> 6652.43s]  If you're going to go talk to some, like if you want to appeal to the religious people
[6652.43s -> 6656.59s]  about like why we need to be like stewards of the planet and things like there are ways
[6656.59s -> 6662.27s]  of appealing to these different areas. But at the end of the day, it's just an ethical
[6663.31s -> 6668.91s]  thing. It's like you are placing, it's a value that we hold,
[6669.95s -> 6673.07s]  but it's not an objective value. And that's the biggest hurdle.
[6673.07s -> 6677.39s]  Do we need wilderness in your opinion? In my opinion, absolutely.
[6678.03s -> 6688.59s]  But that's, that is a value that I hold dear. You know what I mean? And I mean, not just for like
[6688.59s -> 6693.39s]  the tangible things that we can point to as far as wilderness, but I mean the intangible
[6693.39s -> 6697.31s]  things, you know, there's a lot of like old like, I don't know. I don't know who said,
[6697.31s -> 6701.71s]  you know, again, we were talking about like the pop culture figure, whether it's like Edward
[6702.67s -> 6707.23s]  Abbey or something or yeah, like these people that like say these like famous quotes,
[6707.23s -> 6711.63s]  but just having the wilderness, I think maybe, I don't know. I don't know who it was,
[6711.63s -> 6716.51s]  but like the quote about like wilderness is valuable to just know that it exists
[6716.51s -> 6721.23s]  like from a psychological standpoint, the fact that you can walk to the edge and peer
[6721.23s -> 6728.11s]  and gaze in to the unknown is like a valuable thing for like humans, psychology and psyche
[6728.11s -> 6734.19s]  to like know if that was like gone would be like detrimental. But again, these are like wild
[6734.19s -> 6744.32s]  philosophical like things that like, who are we to say that like people can't burn the world?
[6744.88s -> 6750.32s]  You know, it's just a value. It's like human life is a value. Everything is a value. It's
[6750.32s -> 6754.64s]  just a judgment on the world that you see around you and a quality of life,
[6754.64s -> 6760.24s]  which is super subjective thing. And at the end of the day, it's hard for us to zoom as
[6760.24s -> 6765.36s]  human beings to zoom out that much and look at something so like coldly and objectively.
[6765.36s -> 6769.12s]  But that is the reality of it is like, everything is a value.
[6769.84s -> 6770.72s]  Have you ever read the book?
[6770.72s -> 6776.16s]  Genocide is a value. You know, every it's like you can go you can take it to whatever length
[6776.16s -> 6780.88s]  you want to take it to. But it's like, so when you talk about something as simple as like,
[6780.88s -> 6785.92s]  oh, I don't want like a tram in the LCR gorge. It's like that's about that's a very
[6786.72s -> 6794.24s]  value based and and and very subjective. I know that there's probably a lot more people
[6794.24s -> 6798.08s]  in the world that would love to take a tramway down to the bottom of the Grand Canyon and get
[6798.08s -> 6805.23s]  an ice cream cone. But and stay at a nice five star hotel right on the rim of Marble Canyon.
[6805.23s -> 6809.95s]  There's probably there's not probably guaranteed there are more people that would
[6809.95s -> 6813.31s]  think that was awesome in this world than would think that would suck.
[6814.19s -> 6824.59s]  Um, so I have very I have strong values, but I also like, yeah, there's just a million different
[6824.59s -> 6826.03s]  like, I don't know.
[6826.03s -> 6827.47s]  Have you read the book ecotopia?
[6828.43s -> 6829.63s]  I don't think so. No.
[6829.63s -> 6839.79s]  Okay, really quick. It's the the plot is the year is like 1975. And 11 years prior,
[6839.79s -> 6845.23s]  there was this civil war in the United States, and the entire west coast of the
[6845.95s -> 6851.95s]  US secedes from the Union. So it's like Oregon, Washington, like I think it's northern California,
[6851.95s -> 6857.63s]  and they secede to live out what they see as like the most perfect undisputed environmental
[6857.63s -> 6861.63s]  values. And they build a society of like coexistence around that. So it's not so much
[6861.63s -> 6866.75s]  wilderness, but it's just like them living in as close to perfect harmony with the rest of
[6866.75s -> 6871.87s]  the environment as possible. And the book is all about this guy who lives in New York City.
[6871.87s -> 6876.11s]  He's part of the rest of the US. And it's the first time that the president of this
[6876.11s -> 6881.55s]  new country is allowing foreigners in post civil war. And so like, the chapters are
[6881.55s -> 6886.67s]  alternating, like starts with like one chapter is like his journal diary of just like his
[6886.67s -> 6891.15s]  insights living there and being embedded in it. And then the next chapter will be the
[6891.15s -> 6895.47s]  dispatch that he sends back to the New York Times, like reporting back on what he's seeing.
[6896.27s -> 6901.71s]  And ever since I read that book, until I've talked with you today, like my
[6903.15s -> 6906.99s]  I've always wanted to have the belief that we didn't need to set aside anything
[6907.79s -> 6914.99s]  that like the most optimistic thing we could do is just to like work on reforming and like
[6914.99s -> 6918.91s]  trying to like undo a lot of the bullshit, the urban sprawl stuff that we've created and
[6918.91s -> 6922.91s]  like, live as harmoniously as possible. Like wouldn't it be nice if we didn't even need
[6922.91s -> 6926.03s]  wilderness because we were like amazing stewards. And
[6926.83s -> 6933.47s]  Well, yeah, I actually I'm in the US is, I think, a really interesting example of what
[6933.47s -> 6936.83s]  we're talking about, because I don't I don't want to give off the impression that I'm like
[6936.83s -> 6941.87s]  anti national park. Like, like, I think that but I think you made a great argument. I
[6941.87s -> 6950.59s]  think I think you made a great argument that you can thank national parks for creating a
[6950.59s -> 6960.43s]  system that has protected like, you know, if, if it wasn't for national parks, you know,
[6961.07s -> 6967.87s]  grand Tetons would be like here. Or like, like, like Europe didn't have the opportunity
[6968.83s -> 6974.03s]  to set aside these national parks, there's already people living everywhere. Right? So
[6974.03s -> 6977.23s]  there's not like there. I mean, there are wilderness areas in Europe, and they're
[6977.47s -> 6980.67s]  awesome. But it's like, we kicked the Native Americans off all these lands.
[6982.03s -> 6988.51s]  Yeah, but again, I mean, I'll preface what I'm about to say with I agree with you. But again,
[6988.51s -> 6998.53s]  even that is like super like, that's not like an objective way of looking at it.
[6998.53s -> 7002.69s]  Like that, that's it's like, and again, again, I don't want to, I don't want to get like,
[7002.69s -> 7008.53s]  like, I agree with you that that was like a thing that happened. Like, obviously. But it's
[7008.53s -> 7014.61s]  just like, you zoom way out of like human existence and like human consciousness, and just it's like,
[7015.49s -> 7020.69s]  it's like, yes, that's a thing that happens, like everywhere, all the like, all the time
[7020.69s -> 7024.13s]  throughout history. There's like, let's still live in Canyon de Chez. There's like houses
[7024.13s -> 7027.97s]  deep in Canyon de Chez, Navajos that live there. Yeah, I mean, there are people being
[7027.97s -> 7032.77s]  removed from lands today, all over the world. Yeah, which I don't want to talk about that
[7032.77s -> 7042.35s]  either. But it's like, so like the, like, if it wasn't for the national parks, we would like,
[7042.91s -> 7048.51s]  the US is unique in the sense of being like a modern western country and still having,
[7048.51s -> 7054.35s]  you know, like 90%, or I think it's like 92% of Alaska is like public land.
[7055.31s -> 7059.87s]  You know what I mean? It's like, it's like, I think, like, I forget, I don't like saying
[7059.87s -> 7064.11s]  numbers on podcasts, because they're never right, or like statistics. But it's like,
[7064.11s -> 7068.67s]  something like half of Arizona is like public land. You know what I mean? Like that doesn't exist
[7069.95s -> 7074.51s]  almost anywhere else in the world. And it's like, and it's because of national parks,
[7074.51s -> 7080.35s]  and it's because of all of this thing. Because of national parks, wilderness areas can exist
[7080.35s -> 7094.51s]  today post 1960s. But like, the idea that the idea that humans will leave something alone,
[7094.51s -> 7101.46s]  I just don't I just don't think is a realistic like policy. You know, like moving forward
[7101.46s -> 7106.02s]  for like future generations, maybe in like, like small scale stuff, obviously, it's fine,
[7106.02s -> 7110.74s]  if you can, you can do that small scale segregation just seems so weird to me,
[7110.74s -> 7116.26s]  like in any in any concept. Yeah, and obviously, like as an ideal, of course, I like support
[7116.26s -> 7120.26s]  that idea. And I think that it's like a really interesting ideal. But I also I also think that
[7120.26s -> 7125.62s]  like man is and can be or like should be a part of nature as much as possible. And it's
[7125.62s -> 7136.50s]  like, so like, I think the the areas that but I just think it's like it's human. It's just
[7136.50s -> 7140.82s]  part of the human experience. And it's part of the human species in general is to like
[7140.82s -> 7147.94s]  we're at a point in our evolution to like, destroy everything around us. But also everything that
[7147.94s -> 7153.22s]  we destroy are just are just things that we have perceived value of. So it's like
[7155.14s -> 7160.10s]  the earth will like like this like George Carlin always talks about this. It's like it's
[7160.10s -> 7165.94s]  like, like environment, like environmentalists, like they don't care about the earth.
[7166.90s -> 7172.82s]  And that's a distinction. Like they're not pro earth. They're pro having a nice place to live.
[7173.62s -> 7178.58s]  Like the earth will be fine. It's the people who are fucked. And that's a different thing.
[7180.02s -> 7185.46s]  It's like, and that's fine, too. Like if I mean, I don't I don't know, again, it's all
[7185.46s -> 7189.46s]  just to keep repeating. It's all value based. So it's like if humans burn themselves out,
[7189.46s -> 7194.10s]  then so be it. It's like it. It's nice to be at a point. This is like a George Carlin
[7194.10s -> 7199.94s]  thing to have. I love George Carlin. Where it's like I've given up on having like a
[7201.14s -> 7206.18s]  I'm not quite to this point yet. I think it's nice to say that you are in like idealistic.
[7209.86s -> 7215.46s]  Like I don't have a horse in the race anymore. Where it's like I'm able to look at humanity
[7215.46s -> 7226.02s]  with this like awe both positively and negatively. But like I've dropped out of having a horse in
[7226.02s -> 7233.46s]  the race. Like I don't I don't care anymore. It's like I can't care anymore. It's like I
[7233.46s -> 7241.94s]  don't admire 90 percent of what I see in humanity. So like I have to I like retract
[7241.94s -> 7248.26s]  from it and just observe it and just stand in awe of all of these things. Because it's like
[7249.46s -> 7253.54s]  I you know I wake up like I have friends that wake up in the morning stressed about
[7253.54s -> 7260.42s]  who the president of the United States is. It's like I have to I had a certain point
[7260.42s -> 7264.98s]  like I haven't you know completely dropped out. But I admire those who have.
[7265.94s -> 7271.54s]  And I think that it's like especially in the United States like I don't want to you know be
[7271.54s -> 7278.02s]  dramatic which I am about to be like clearly dramatic. But it's like I don't know. I feel
[7278.02s -> 7282.58s]  like we're still at a point in American society where like they're not rounding people up. So
[7282.58s -> 7288.50s]  we can like get out while we can. It's like it's like it's not as bad as it could be.
[7288.50s -> 7297.42s]  So it's like yeah I don't know. You know just the whole thing with I mean to maybe move away
[7297.42s -> 7301.90s]  from that direction of conversation and back to like public lands. You know I was like
[7301.90s -> 7306.70s]  nothing is safe. I was like we think things are safe. But I mean that was just a thing
[7306.70s -> 7313.10s]  that happened right. Like they were going to sell off however much of all of our public lands you
[7313.10s -> 7319.66s]  know. And like like all of Marble Canyon which we were just talking about like was in that bill
[7319.66s -> 7325.98s]  you know. And it's like so nothing is safe. Nothing is sacred. Nothing is precious. It's
[7326.54s -> 7332.46s]  all open for whatever new wave of society comes along and they have different values and they
[7332.46s -> 7338.14s]  have different things. We currently exist in our society and we have these values and we
[7338.14s -> 7342.78s]  have these things that we hold dear and really important. And I hold those things as well.
[7343.66s -> 7347.58s]  But I'm also able to acknowledge that those are just products of my society and of my
[7347.58s -> 7352.46s]  psychology and of like what I consider to be like reality and important and all these things.
[7352.46s -> 7360.94s]  And it's like those things change drastically you know from society. I mean even in the same
[7360.94s -> 7365.98s]  world you know you can go to other parts of the world and it's very different values.
[7370.83s -> 7371.39s]  I don't know.
[7372.27s -> 7377.55s]  Well I and I actually like doing it this way.
[7377.55s -> 7379.55s]  I'm definitely not talking about running are we?
[7379.55s -> 7384.19s]  No we're not. And here's the thing. I mean well a couple of things. Number one
[7384.19s -> 7390.51s]  I don't know how to end these conversations except abruptly. And I think this is actually
[7390.51s -> 7394.19s]  a good place to stop because I hope we can do another one of these. I hope we can do like
[7394.19s -> 7399.39s]  one of these a year. Sure. Well let's I mean no the whole point right was we left the last
[7399.39s -> 7402.67s]  one. It was like let's do this one after you're a dad. So let's talk about that.
[7405.01s -> 7409.09s]  I am a dad. Yeah. I am a dad. What do you want to know?
[7409.09s -> 7413.17s]  I don't know. God I'm not good at interviewing.
[7413.49s -> 7420.51s]  Uh are they here? No. They stayed home? No. And how does that feel?
[7421.07s -> 7426.83s]  It sucks because I get the sense just from observing my daughter that
[7428.59s -> 7431.63s]  like they're at that stage in life where every single day is a lifetime.
[7432.59s -> 7439.31s]  Yeah. She's like a year old. 11 months next week. Every day is a lifetime and I mean
[7439.31s -> 7444.03s]  I've been gone for 10 days now and I'm gone for four more. The worst. It's the worst.
[7444.03s -> 7450.83s]  And you just miss a ton of milestones and um. You actually don't. I think it's good to remind
[7450.83s -> 7457.55s]  like because I feel that I feel the exact same way. Yeah. As you but it's like
[7459.98s -> 7462.70s]  they're still there. You know what I mean? And it's like
[7464.54s -> 7472.35s]  you because about two to three times a year I have to leave for about a week.
[7472.35s -> 7476.19s]  Yep. And I've had to do that and it's like those are always really hard.
[7476.19s -> 7479.87s]  I mean that's a big part of why they're here now is because I had to come for two weeks and
[7479.87s -> 7483.71s]  I'm like I'm not doing two weeks. Yeah. It's like that's too long. Like I don't care how
[7483.71s -> 7488.11s]  shitty it is. I don't care how difficult it is. Like I don't care how expensive it is like
[7489.63s -> 7494.75s]  like you have to come. I'll tell you the biggest thing I'm grappling with right now
[7494.75s -> 7501.39s]  is and it will only become more at the surface when I'm when they're older and I'm
[7501.39s -> 7509.31s]  older. I'm obsessed with the fact that I do not want to mislead them in life and I want to make
[7509.31s -> 7514.59s]  sure and one of the biggest priorities for me is that regardless of whether they appreciate
[7514.59s -> 7519.63s]  what I'm doing I don't want there to be any mistake that a I love what I'm doing.
[7520.35s -> 7526.19s]  B I think it's an educated guess at what possibly makes sense to do in this world
[7527.07s -> 7533.79s]  and that like I'm to as much as I can possible be like pro-social and like
[7533.79s -> 7539.07s]  serve something or help something. And so I think like they've heard me ad naus in the
[7539.07s -> 7543.39s]  past couple of days like get really self-reflective about even just like the value of coming here to
[7543.39s -> 7548.59s]  Shama need to do media for UTMB. Yeah. I don't think it's a bad thing but again like
[7548.59s -> 7552.51s]  like you said you want to impress your you want to impress your kid and I find myself like
[7552.59s -> 7560.27s]  wanting to impress my daughter and yeah that that's been hard for me is realizing that
[7560.27s -> 7569.09s]  what I perceive to be like a really good upbringing or like a really interesting
[7569.09s -> 7575.25s]  engaging upbringing is not necessarily what a two-year-old wants. So like I like I went into
[7575.25s -> 7580.45s]  like I went into being a father as being like we're going to travel the world you're going
[7580.45s -> 7587.01s]  to like live this like lifestyle you're going to like have French godparents and Spanish godparents
[7587.01s -> 7591.01s]  and you're going to be like this child of the world like experience in the world and it's
[7591.01s -> 7596.13s]  like no a two-year-old wants to be at home all the time. She doesn't want to leave home she
[7596.13s -> 7601.49s]  wants to read books she wants to read 40 fucking books a day and like be at home and
[7601.57s -> 7610.13s]  hang out with mom and dad and like I'm like oh like right like my sort of like projection
[7611.41s -> 7614.77s]  on it maybe when she's older she'll want that but until then like
[7616.29s -> 7621.49s]  being sort of a boring parent or like a more not a boring parent but that that's too harsh
[7621.49s -> 7626.21s]  but just like more of a like a traditional parent is like that's what stable a stable
[7626.21s -> 7632.21s]  parent is like that's what a kid wants you know and it's like so like I was really excited
[7632.21s -> 7638.69s]  to have the opportunity to give my child like a lifestyle that I wished that I had
[7640.53s -> 7649.97s]  and that's not necessarily the case or like or projecting certain values onto a toddler
[7649.97s -> 7654.77s]  where it's like you know what I mean or it's like but and that's not to say that like you
[7654.77s -> 7658.69s]  can't adjust those things or like be there or like show like what you were saying like
[7660.94s -> 7665.10s]  show them the world and like teach them all of those things in the best way that you know
[7665.10s -> 7677.66s]  how to do that and like but yeah and maybe that that that's been more I feel like so
[7677.66s -> 7683.66s]  so my daughter just turned two so she's she's a year apart but kind of a world apart
[7684.38s -> 7687.66s]  from your daughter right because a year when you're two years old is a bit
[7688.30s -> 7697.78s]  and that's been really interesting she's like you know personality and and language
[7698.50s -> 7704.34s]  and all of these things and she has very like I don't know when it happened but it'll
[7704.34s -> 7707.94s]  happen for you in the next I don't remember exactly when it happened but all of a sudden
[7707.94s -> 7716.58s]  this kid has like desires of its own like has very strong like doesn't just go with the flow
[7716.58s -> 7722.18s]  yeah like exactly like I want this or I don't want that and it's like that that's like
[7722.18s -> 7728.77s]  navigating that is just like really interesting and yeah especially for I mean
[7730.69s -> 7737.01s]  for parents who are I think I think I assume that you're similar like sort of like
[7737.01s -> 7744.37s]  hyper engaged and thoughtful parents right it's like um because not everyone is that
[7744.37s -> 7751.41s]  unfortunately but it's like it it's like this ongoing exercise and I gotta give you like this
[7751.41s -> 7756.77s]  I think this is a story that really quick story that I think just represents the joys of
[7756.77s -> 7762.05s]  parenthood a couple weeks ago my wife Jules and I were traveling and we're at the airport
[7762.05s -> 7767.57s]  and it's like 10 o'clock at night and we like need this flight back to salt lake right because
[7767.57s -> 7773.25s]  if we don't it's just gonna like upend everything chaos and we get to the checkout counter
[7773.25s -> 7777.41s]  whatever you call that thing and we find out you know we're in like a long line and then
[7777.41s -> 7781.17s]  we find out that the flights cans we have to and then all the airport hotels are booked we
[7781.17s -> 7786.21s]  have to go like take an uber like 30 minutes out around New York City to find a spot and
[7786.21s -> 7790.93s]  like Jules and I are about to freak out you see everyone in line they're like in tears
[7790.93s -> 7796.37s]  freaking out and our daughter's just on like a blanket you know they're at the gate just being
[7796.37s -> 7802.77s]  like yeah and she's just she cannot obviously cannot grasp the situation but like somehow
[7802.77s -> 7808.61s]  she has chosen joy and curiosity and just excitement to be wherever she is and so I
[7808.61s -> 7812.85s]  think one of the big things that I've appreciated since she's been born is doing
[7812.85s -> 7818.53s]  my best no matter the circumstance that I'm in to just like appreciate being there first
[7818.61s -> 7825.73s]  yeah and on that note I think that there are a lot of things that parents do in this world that
[7826.77s -> 7833.65s]  are not just like there there are a lot of actions just whether it be at the airport
[7833.65s -> 7838.85s]  or whether it be your business or whether it be your home or all of these things there's
[7838.85s -> 7845.49s]  a lot of decisions that we make that we genuinely feel are for our kids like and
[7845.49s -> 7853.65s]  I say I say I choose those words for a reason because it's like it's not like we it's like
[7853.65s -> 7858.13s]  oh I have to do this for a kid but I'm really doing it for myself or like or all these other
[7858.13s -> 7863.81s]  things like no we genuinely feel that we're doing this for our kid you know like whether
[7863.81s -> 7868.69s]  it be like financial or whether it be a roof over their head or any of these things like
[7868.69s -> 7872.77s]  when I look at my own experience as a child and being raised by a single mother
[7873.25s -> 7881.57s]  and like she genuinely felt like she had to be at work you know 12 hours a day every single day
[7881.57s -> 7887.81s]  for my entire childhood and teenage years so I was essentially raised alone like by myself
[7887.81s -> 7892.29s]  especially like teenage years because you know I was by myself all the time and it was like
[7893.81s -> 7901.65s]  like she wasn't doing that to be selfish right she was doing that for me because she
[7901.65s -> 7906.69s]  genuinely felt those things but what I'm realizing now is that like all of these things
[7906.69s -> 7917.20s]  that we do that are genuinely for our children like don't really matter like like like as much
[7917.20s -> 7921.60s]  as we like think that they do like they don't they don't they're not that important like
[7921.60s -> 7925.92s]  I would have rather lived in a van with my mom and driven around the country so presence
[7926.48s -> 7932.32s]  presence is everything okay and and like kids don't care about your house
[7933.52s -> 7937.28s]  like they don't care if they live in a shitty apartment you care and that's fine if you care
[7937.28s -> 7942.16s]  about I'm not even saying anything about that like like but your kid doesn't give a shit
[7942.16s -> 7946.48s]  whether or not you live maybe when they're teenagers they start to care a little bit but
[7946.48s -> 7952.32s]  like when they're kids like they don't care about being poor they care if you're there or
[7952.32s -> 7957.60s]  not and so it's like that's a thing for me is like the financial side of things like I'm you know
[7957.60s -> 7962.72s]  I'm spoiled I'm lucky I have you know I'm a fucking athlete like I don't have I don't have
[7962.72s -> 7967.04s]  anything to complain about it's like that's another thing like Jeff and I talk about all
[7967.04s -> 7970.48s]  the time like yes we get stressed out about things but the reality is like we get paid to
[7970.48s -> 7974.40s]  do what we'd be doing anyways it's like there's a reason why people want to be sponsored
[7974.40s -> 7979.12s]  athletes you know it's like because it's a sweet cake anyway that's another conversation
[7979.12s -> 7986.72s]  but all I'm saying is that like like I would have preferred to be poor and with my mom
[7986.72s -> 7995.36s]  than have her work my entire life I think right like I don't know is that a conversation
[7995.36s -> 7998.80s]  you've had with her no because I don't want to offend her and hopefully she doesn't listen to
[7998.80s -> 8002.40s]  this because I don't want her to feel like I didn't I don't appreciate what she did for me
[8002.40s -> 8009.76s]  yeah because I absolutely do and in every sense that you can I appreciate everything my
[8009.76s -> 8017.04s]  mom has ever done for me but the reality is I think she could have worked half half as much
[8018.32s -> 8025.52s]  and we could have had it you know more time together you know it's like so like in in
[8026.32s -> 8033.60s]  embracing that as a parent for me is like there's this thing you know like oh we have
[8033.60s -> 8041.07s]  a kid we need to go like buy a new Subaru it's like well like you know there's there's lines in
[8041.07s -> 8044.11s]  the sand or there's like you know there's things like maybe like you know there are other
[8044.11s -> 8048.43s]  considerations there like safety you know that's fine you know things like that but like
[8048.43s -> 8055.55s]  your kid your kid does not care ever yeah yeah so I think in my in my case the tragedy is
[8055.55s -> 8060.27s]  that like I'm here in Chamonix for two weeks and I'm not with my kid but there's a
[8060.27s -> 8064.75s]  balance right so I do the same thing like I have to come to Europe to do things I have to
[8065.95s -> 8071.87s]  go trail mark in the US for a week like when I get back from this I have to go up
[8071.87s -> 8075.63s]  and I have to go up to Bryce Canyon and deal with the shit show because the course
[8075.63s -> 8079.23s]  burned so I have to like go deal with all of that and it's like because we have a race in
[8079.23s -> 8084.75s]  two weeks when I get back and it's like am I going to drag them in the van like a few
[8084.75s -> 8088.67s]  days after getting home from two weeks in Europe like probably not so it's like they're
[8088.67s -> 8094.75s]  like but I you always have to strike a balance and it's like they're again I think we talked
[8094.75s -> 8100.27s]  about this last time there are there are ideal versions of ourselves that we aspire to be
[8100.27s -> 8107.07s]  and where we lack in those idealisms is where we are hypocrites or whatever but it's
[8108.03s -> 8111.63s]  like that's true of everything it's not just with ourselves and with our identities and
[8111.63s -> 8119.47s]  with our personalities but also with like there are you know how you are as a parent
[8120.75s -> 8126.11s]  there are ideal values that we have as a parent and you aspire to attain those ideals as much
[8126.11s -> 8132.11s]  as you can but there are balances so like yes I have to leave for like a total of probably
[8132.11s -> 8137.47s]  three to four weeks out of the year and not be with my daughter but I'm also able to not
[8137.47s -> 8143.47s]  have a real job and like I'm there every morning when she wakes up and I spend all day with her
[8143.47s -> 8149.71s]  when when I am present and it's like like we're essentially both stay-at-home parents because I
[8149.71s -> 8153.47s]  have to leave for a month out of the year so that's 10 percent of the year that I'm not
[8153.47s -> 8159.95s]  able to spend with her but which I think is more than most parents get right so it's like
[8159.95s -> 8165.55s]  that's the trade-off so it's like and again everyone is going to find their own trade-off
[8165.55s -> 8170.51s]  with that and and that's the thing is like it's a it's a privileged thing to get to be able to do
[8170.51s -> 8177.31s]  that like every parent wants to spend all their time with their kid of course they do but not
[8177.31s -> 8183.15s]  everyone can there are like but I don't I don't I feel like I'm giving like recommendations or
[8183.15s -> 8190.50s]  something but like I'm not but I but I would say that like for myself and maybe for you and
[8190.50s -> 8195.62s]  maybe for my friends and conversations about this about like how to be the best parents
[8195.62s -> 8202.66s]  we can possibly be is like just fucking be there like it's not that hard I mean it's hard to do it
[8203.22s -> 8209.06s]  but intellectually it's not that hard it's like just always be there as much as you can
[8210.18s -> 8213.94s]  and don't resent your kids for like ruining your nightlife or something or whatever that
[8213.94s -> 8218.98s]  or whatever whatever that is but I mean it helps being older too I mean I think we're both
[8218.98s -> 8226.58s]  like older so it's like no yeah I know a lot of people I think not resent is a strong word
[8226.58s -> 8233.62s]  but I think a lot of people like have like this like oh you like ruined my 20s or
[8233.62s -> 8239.14s]  not ruined but you took away my I'm having a hard time finding a nice way of saying that but
[8241.22s -> 8247.30s]  yeah being being older is helpful and you know being in a good spot in life is helpful
[8249.78s -> 8256.50s]  Well yeah I think I think I'm actually glad we extended it I think this is the perfect place
[8256.50s -> 8262.74s]  to end it and before we hit stop I just want to make a note of appreciation and gratitude to you
[8262.74s -> 8268.50s]  I always deeply appreciate these conversations and I started off the conversation inquiring
[8268.50s -> 8272.66s]  about just like the fact that you're so multifaceted you've got the carpentry angle
[8273.38s -> 8279.54s]  the public lands angle like I just I think when I lose interest in the sport it's because
[8280.98s -> 8287.62s]  it's hard to explore for me the places outside running with a lot of guests and you make it
[8287.62s -> 8294.34s]  easy I think Adam so I was in Oakland with Adam yeah and he was talking about a conversation
[8294.34s -> 8301.22s]  he had with you and I feel like like I don't know I grew up like what so this is a total
[8301.22s -> 8305.86s]  tangent and I'll try and keep it as short as possible like I grew up watching like WWF
[8306.42s -> 8312.74s]  yeah you know in this like era of like characters of these like larger-than-life characters
[8312.74s -> 8318.98s]  of like interesting engaging and now like I don't watch I haven't watched it in 20 years
[8318.98s -> 8325.14s]  you know probably but it's like I just like feel like today it's just like a guy with a
[8325.14s -> 8330.66s]  name you know like there's no like undertakers or like there's no he's like like these mythic
[8330.66s -> 8334.50s]  like who's the heel at you too yeah or like no not not even the heel but I just feel like
[8334.50s -> 8339.46s]  ultra running in general like lacks this like I think this was the conversation Adam I think
[8339.46s -> 8344.66s]  had with you that he was alluding to like it's just like not the characters that there used
[8344.66s -> 8350.10s]  to be yeah or something like that like that like it's just like it's just and obviously
[8350.10s -> 8354.58s]  this is the way this is the evolution of things like a sport becomes like a real sport
[8354.58s -> 8360.58s]  it becomes about performance and it becomes about like you know and again not to I don't
[8360.58s -> 8365.38s]  want to like you know say anything negative about anything but like most of the runners
[8365.38s -> 8370.02s]  at the top of our sport are just like obsessive athletes that have prioritized
[8371.06s -> 8376.58s]  being a professional athlete and just like and they've done that since high school high school
[8376.58s -> 8383.50s]  college into professional athlete and it's like there's just not a lot of other stuff there
[8383.50s -> 8387.58s]  or like you know and again I know that probably sounds mean or whatever but it's like
[8389.18s -> 8392.78s]  it's just kind of honest but that's what it takes right so it's like as you move
[8392.78s -> 8400.22s]  as a sport evolves you like like the the the characters aren't winning these races anymore
[8400.22s -> 8405.50s]  like you said you had Anton here you know like right before me it's like the Anton's of
[8405.50s -> 8410.62s]  the world aren't winning Leadville anymore you know it's like it's the it's the hyper competitive
[8410.62s -> 8416.06s]  professional athletes and it's like not that he wasn't an incredible athlete my question is is
[8416.06s -> 8425.44s]  is character an inevitable sacrifice of high performance I have no idea I don't know I don't
[8425.44s -> 8432.96s]  think so I don't think so either uh yeah but I don't know I yeah I don't think so but what
[8432.96s -> 8441.70s]  you're also seeing with the growth of a sport is like there are spaces for um like I'm here
[8441.70s -> 8450.50s]  in UTMB like I'm and I'm not here because of my running prowess and that's just an acknowledgement
[8450.50s -> 8459.46s]  on my end yeah the reality of it is like like I I have to come to terms and this is really
[8459.46s -> 8468.90s]  hard for me to say just in a conversation in my hotel room let alone on a podcast but like I
[8468.90s -> 8473.30s]  have to come to terms with the fact that you could make an argument that like I am an influencer
[8475.14s -> 8480.98s]  because the reality is is like I don't win big races and I am technically a sponsored athlete
[8482.58s -> 8486.58s]  so it's like that's hard for me to say out loud and hard for me to accept about myself
[8486.58s -> 8490.90s]  but it's acknowledging the situation that I am in so I think and where I'm going with this is
[8490.90s -> 8499.86s]  that like as the sport grows there is room for characters like I think that in a way I am a
[8499.86s -> 8506.42s]  bit of a character and I mean I'm on a fucking float a can there's a cartoon and a soda can
[8506.42s -> 8514.98s]  you know what I mean it's like so it's like um there there's a space for it I don't know
[8514.98s -> 8520.34s]  what that space is at all but there is a space for it we're not winning leadville we're not
[8520.34s -> 8527.94s]  winning UTMB we're not going to win western states but as you said it doesn't have to come
[8527.94s -> 8533.62s]  at the expense of character no I just wondered that for a second for some reason I think Jim
[8533.62s -> 8538.34s]  is an interesting character oh my gosh amazing you know it's like like it doesn't like I don't
[8538.34s -> 8542.50s]  know a lot of these other guys but you know like I think Jim is a really interesting guy
[8542.50s -> 8548.50s]  it's like it and has just as much of an interesting background and story in life as I've had
[8548.50s -> 8553.14s]  potentially more like you know it's like it's just it's just so different and it's and it's
[8553.14s -> 8558.10s]  sometimes I do think it comes down to timing and when you catch people and where you catch
[8558.10s -> 8563.38s]  them for conversations and engagement and for example we caught Jim at western this year
[8563.94s -> 8567.62s]  when he had no obligations to race he could kind of like shrug his shoulders and just
[8567.62s -> 8573.06s]  lay back and it was the it was a great conversation and admittedly the year before
[8573.06s -> 8577.70s]  when he was doing western we had him in and it was like a stilted awkward conversation I think
[8577.70s -> 8581.06s]  for us you know what I mean like he was probably just in a different mindset we were
[8581.06s -> 8587.54s]  in a different mindset and so I think timing for a lot of humans matters too for sure yeah
[8587.54s -> 8593.30s]  so anyways appreciate you yeah you too
