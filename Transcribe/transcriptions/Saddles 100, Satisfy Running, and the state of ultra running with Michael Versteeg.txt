[0.00s -> 5.24s]  I don't, it's kind of like what I said in the email. I don't really like short, like
[5.24s -> 11.60s]  if I'm going to take the time to like sit down and talk to somebody, they like throw
[11.60s -> 15.68s]  a bunch of questions at me and then I say like some generic things in 30 seconds and
[15.68s -> 19.64s]  then we like move on. It's like, not very compelling. If I'm going to sit down and
[19.64s -> 22.48s]  talk to somebody, I'd rather like get into some stuff.
[22.48s -> 25.78s]  First off, thanks. I do appreciate it. I know you're busy. I said, it looked
[25.78s -> 28.86s]  like you had something to do with Black Canyons this weekend. At the very least
[28.86s -> 33.26s]  you were riding pretty cool three wheeler thing through through town.
[34.18s -> 39.26s]  Yeah, I mean, Satisfying and Aerovipa are like becoming more and more involved
[39.26s -> 42.82s]  with each other. So, yeah, it seems like they're coming out for a lot of
[42.82s -> 47.90s]  the races now. And, um, and then I actually like races like flying out
[47.90s -> 53.74s]  for them. Yeah, that's great. Yeah. I mean, cause they're like they're
[53.74s -> 57.66s]  coming on as like sponsors of the events and just
[58.86s -> 64.50s]  yeah, all that stuff. So, um, yeah, I, and then I actually ended up running the
[64.50s -> 68.30s]  60K yesterday. Oh, you did. I know you're training for
[68.30s -> 72.74s]  Cocodona. Was that just like a spur of the moment thing to jump in?
[72.74s -> 75.66s]  Or did you, were you marking the course at all? Were you, did you have
[75.66s -> 80.90s]  any responsibilities? No, I was just there because of Satisfying and
[80.90s -> 86.30s]  there were a couple of Satisfying runners running and, um, yeah, I was
[86.30s -> 90.38s]  just hanging out and I didn't, I wasn't planning on running and Saturday I was
[90.38s -> 95.50s]  like there all day and I just felt sort of useless. I was like just sort of
[95.50s -> 99.46s]  like milling about. So I was like, well, if I'm going to be out here,
[99.46s -> 106.70s]  like maybe I'll just run. So I ended up running yesterday. Nice. Yeah.
[106.70s -> 111.18s]  Which those fucking short races, they're like hard. Yeah. Why do you
[111.18s -> 113.98s]  push it? Like do you redline longer or is it just like, if you're
[113.98s -> 116.26s]  going to do it, you want to make it worth it, just like these interviews?
[117.70s -> 122.06s]  Yeah, I don't know. I just, it's like, yeah, you just try hard at short races.
[122.06s -> 126.26s]  I'm not good at trying hard. You, yeah, like I feel like sometimes the worst I
[126.26s -> 131.78s]  feel after races are like 50Ks, you know? Yeah. Yeah. You're just running
[131.78s -> 134.90s]  as, at least for me, like I can't run that fast, you know? So it's
[134.90s -> 141.26s]  like, like my like marathon 50K pace is probably like as fast as I can
[141.26s -> 147.82s]  run, you know? I'm just running as fast as I can run for like yesterday's
[147.82s -> 151.66s]  like almost five hours. I mean, were you a marathoner? Were you a road
[151.66s -> 154.58s]  guy for, or did you just grow up on the trails?
[154.58s -> 161.78s]  Kind of neither actually. I, yeah, I've never, I never ran, I never
[161.78s -> 168.10s]  ran officially in as like in high school or college or anything. Yeah.
[168.10s -> 174.26s]  I have a pretty long like just sort of outdoor sports background. So I was
[174.26s -> 178.70s]  always like, like I've always, you know, I've been a climber for a long
[178.70s -> 182.18s]  time and just like sort of like mountainism and mountaineering. And
[182.18s -> 186.42s]  I've always sort of gravitated towards, even in that phase of my
[186.42s -> 190.10s]  life where I was like doing bigger mountains and stuff, it was like, I
[190.10s -> 197.18s]  always sort of gravitated towards just like speed, you know? Yeah. Speed
[197.26s -> 201.74s]  in the mountains is safety. And it's like, so like I always gravitated
[201.74s -> 206.82s]  towards moving light and fast. And, you know, I didn't call it running, but
[206.82s -> 211.14s]  it's like, so yeah, when I started running, I like, you know, I kind
[211.14s -> 214.54s]  of took to it pretty fast, you know, because I was like, it was
[214.54s -> 217.38s]  already pretty fit. So yeah. And then it just sort of, you know,
[217.38s -> 221.18s]  just sort of snowballed from there. And it's like trail, trail running
[221.18s -> 225.82s]  is sort of just an extension of that, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. I think
[225.82s -> 229.94s]  it's why I don't, like, I still, I mean, don't really like, like, I
[229.94s -> 232.82s]  wouldn't really call myself like a runner. It's like, I'm like, I'm
[232.82s -> 236.78s]  not that good at running. It's like, it's like the things I do good
[236.78s -> 239.50s]  and running at are just like the really long, like, really.
[241.94s -> 243.30s]  The ones where you just got to keep going.
[243.78s -> 247.30s]  Yeah, it's more just about like grinding something out. Yeah. Like
[247.30s -> 251.14s]  the worse the conditions, the better I'll do, you know, like the
[251.14s -> 254.06s]  weather is really inclement and the terrain is really like,
[254.54s -> 259.34s]  gnarly. And it's like, I'll stand a chance at those races. You'll
[259.34s -> 262.18s]  outlast, you've got some sort of like mental thing, like mental
[262.18s -> 265.46s]  toughness that you, you'll kind of outlast in the, the, the
[265.46s -> 266.82s]  more gnarly the situation.
[267.14s -> 270.30s]  Yeah. And just, I mean, just having experience like being in
[270.66s -> 274.70s]  outdoors and, you know, and in rough situations. Yeah. You
[274.70s -> 278.06s]  know, it's like, but yeah, I'm not like a super, like, I'm
[278.06s -> 281.50s]  not like a runner, runner.
[281.70s -> 287.50s]  Yeah. I mean, you first came on my radar, the first year of
[287.50s -> 294.90s]  Cocodona, probably. Was that 2020 or 21? I want to say it
[294.90s -> 298.26s]  was, it was whatever, it was refreshing because I felt like
[298.26s -> 300.26s]  we were in like in the throes of the pandemic. So it was
[300.26s -> 303.78s]  great to see like a race and then, you know, the scope of
[303.78s -> 309.82s]  coverage of an inaugural 250 mile or no less, you know,
[309.94s -> 314.14s]  in the, across Arizona. And, you know, just to see you, I'm
[314.14s -> 316.74s]  a fan of Mike McKnight, just because he's a Utah guy. And I
[316.74s -> 319.90s]  tend to, you know, lean toward my Utah guys. And so
[319.90s -> 322.42s]  I was watching, paying attention to what was happening
[322.42s -> 324.70s]  there. And, you know, just seeing you kind of, I don't
[324.70s -> 327.34s]  know if you were wire to wire in the front, but like,
[327.38s -> 331.38s]  you know, just making it look like no big deal. Maybe the
[331.38s -> 333.82s]  camera just caught you at the right time. But I saw you
[333.82s -> 337.10s]  take a shot of whiskey late in the race. Yeah. Talk about
[337.10s -> 339.46s]  European cheater sticks, I believe is what you said in
[339.46s -> 343.66s]  that race. But yeah, it's pretty amazing, amazing
[343.66s -> 344.18s]  coverage.
[345.50s -> 349.26s]  Yeah, that I mean, that first year I didn't need and to be
[349.26s -> 354.42s]  honest, I didn't know anything about the live stream. Well,
[354.42s -> 356.94s]  I mean, I did eventually, but like that whole first day
[356.94s -> 360.14s]  and that like, maybe even into the second, like I just
[360.14s -> 362.50s]  figured Jamil was just making a film because he
[362.50s -> 366.22s]  makes it every race. He always has a camera. And it's like
[366.22s -> 370.70s]  I have a long history with Jamil. So it's like Jamil, like
[370.90s -> 375.62s]  Jamil has been even like even before Cocodona, like he and
[375.62s -> 378.22s]  I have done a ton of stuff together, like film wise. So
[378.22s -> 382.10s]  it's like, even like I remember even out like on
[382.10s -> 384.54s]  the Arizona, like when I was doing the Arizona trail, it's
[384.54s -> 386.70s]  like, I would go like here drone. It was like, oh,
[388.10s -> 390.38s]  Nils here, you know, it's like, that's like how I know
[390.38s -> 396.18s]  if he's around. Yeah. So yeah, I didn't know
[396.18s -> 399.14s]  that they were doing like, no one really set told me or no.
[399.18s -> 401.66s]  So like a lot of the stuff I was doing, I wasn't aware it was
[401.66s -> 405.02s]  being like broadcast. Right. I just thought it was like
[405.02s -> 407.74s]  die in Jamil's editing room, like everything else does.
[410.62s -> 414.90s]  But yeah, I mean, you know, as the race goes on
[414.90s -> 417.38s]  and things progress, you start like hearing things and
[417.38s -> 422.30s]  seeing things and you start. I think that first year was
[422.30s -> 424.78s]  cool because it just like it was something a lot of
[424.78s -> 427.10s]  people, at least in this country, hadn't really seen
[427.10s -> 431.58s]  before. And it seemed like like, like maybe this is just
[431.58s -> 435.18s]  my perspective of it. And maybe it's, you know, because
[435.22s -> 438.22s]  I'm me or whatever. But it seemed like that first year,
[438.22s -> 440.94s]  it was like more of a buzz than like other years, I
[440.94s -> 443.38s]  think. Yeah, people are like kind of used to it or
[443.38s -> 446.58s]  whatever. But it's like, but yeah, I don't know.
[446.62s -> 449.34s]  Yeah, I don't know how he accomplished that level of
[450.22s -> 451.98s]  level of buzz in year one. Because I mean, you know,
[452.42s -> 456.34s]  had you ever done any of Candice Burt's races before
[456.34s -> 458.46s]  that? Was that your first two hundred fifty or two
[458.46s -> 460.58s]  hundred? Yeah, I mean, I don't really I don't do a
[460.58s -> 462.82s]  lot of races. And it's like, I mean, even
[462.82s -> 466.14s]  coca-dona that first year is like, you know, I
[466.14s -> 468.38s]  think Jamil said in the documentary is like, yeah,
[468.38s -> 470.54s]  I just like reached out the week of is like, hey,
[470.54s -> 473.10s]  do you want to do it? Oh, that's right. Yeah. You
[473.10s -> 476.22s]  know, it's like. And so I don't I don't
[477.90s -> 481.18s]  the with with me in races, I mean, unless it's
[481.18s -> 482.74s]  like something like yesterday, we're all just
[482.74s -> 485.42s]  like sort of like hop in just because it's there.
[485.42s -> 487.46s]  And it's like, I mean, I do have a special
[487.46s -> 490.42s]  relationship with Black Canyon, too. I mean, I
[490.42s -> 493.86s]  ran that the first year that existed and it was
[493.86s -> 496.30s]  like 30 of us all like with heat sickness and
[496.30s -> 499.50s]  like was at the same time of year saying like
[499.50s -> 502.78s]  it was a February race. Yeah. But
[505.02s -> 506.74s]  so, yeah, it's like, you know, I like being
[506.74s -> 508.70s]  around that race and like local races and
[508.74s -> 511.18s]  Jamil's races. And so like when coca-dona came
[511.18s -> 513.06s]  around, it was like, yeah, like I'd love to be a
[513.06s -> 516.18s]  part of that. It was like I went in that first
[516.18s -> 518.22s]  year, like pretty cocky about it, too. I was
[518.22s -> 522.34s]  like, oh, like, you know, a multi-day race
[522.34s -> 526.78s]  like across Arizona. Like, yeah, I'm clearly
[526.78s -> 529.90s]  like, that's like clearly my, you know,
[529.90s -> 532.70s]  in my race or whatever. Yeah. Like, I didn't
[532.70s -> 534.66s]  know who Michael McKnight was like at all.
[534.66s -> 537.02s]  And I remember it being at the start line. My
[537.02s -> 539.94s]  friend Tony was there and he was like, he was
[539.94s -> 542.66s]  like, he was like, yeah, I think, you know,
[542.66s -> 544.58s]  like, you know, I got, I got McKnight, like
[544.58s -> 545.86s]  I think McKnight's going to win. I'm like,
[545.86s -> 550.26s]  what? Like who? Oh, oh, you think so, do
[550.26s -> 554.26s]  you? And it's like, so, yeah, I mean,
[554.26s -> 558.06s]  that first year, I was also like, just
[558.06s -> 560.58s]  physically and mentally at a time in my life
[560.58s -> 562.70s]  where like that multi-day thing wasn't that
[562.70s -> 566.10s]  hard for me. It was like, it's like, I
[566.10s -> 568.42s]  feel like now it like, it takes its toll now.
[568.42s -> 570.78s]  I mean, just a few years later, but yeah,
[572.02s -> 574.02s]  it's like, yeah, I was still like mentally
[574.02s -> 577.86s]  sort of in that place where like the
[577.86s -> 581.50s]  idea that like mentally wasn't that
[581.50s -> 583.30s]  intimidating. So I could sort of just like
[583.30s -> 584.54s]  go into it and be like, well, this is
[584.54s -> 586.10s]  what I have to do for the next few days.
[586.10s -> 587.54s]  And you just suck it up and do it, you
[587.54s -> 590.30s]  know? Just what you do. Yeah. Which I
[590.30s -> 591.82s]  don't, I kind of lost a little bit
[592.14s -> 594.42s]  actually. I remember the coverage talking
[594.42s -> 599.26s]  about just like that stretch is, you
[599.26s -> 601.46s]  know, like your home, or at least maybe
[601.46s -> 602.94s]  I'm not as familiar with the course,
[602.94s -> 603.90s]  but there was one moment where he's
[603.90s -> 604.74s]  running through and it's like, oh,
[604.74s -> 606.58s]  hey, you know, Vrsteeg is running
[606.58s -> 609.06s]  through his place that he's run 100
[609.06s -> 610.50s]  times or a thousand times. So he's
[610.50s -> 611.46s]  going to, you know, crush through
[611.46s -> 613.94s]  here. Was that what on that course,
[613.94s -> 615.34s]  like what, what, what area do you
[615.34s -> 616.42s]  think they were talking about then?
[616.42s -> 617.74s]  What's your like, I mean, is
[617.74s -> 620.90s]  Prescott home home that first year?
[620.90s -> 623.38s]  I live about a hundred feet from the
[623.38s -> 626.14s]  course. Okay. Uh, in the Granite
[626.14s -> 629.62s]  Dells. Okay. Um, so yeah, I mean,
[629.62s -> 631.22s]  like we had talked about, we had
[631.22s -> 632.98s]  talked about like me stopping and
[632.98s -> 634.26s]  like taking a shower and like
[634.26s -> 635.58s]  sleeping in my own bed, you know,
[635.58s -> 636.78s]  cause it's lit, it's literally
[636.78s -> 638.42s]  like that's hilarious step off
[638.42s -> 640.42s]  the trail. Yeah. In the Granite
[640.42s -> 642.10s]  Dells and like my, like the
[642.10s -> 643.18s]  house I was living in is right
[643.18s -> 647.42s]  there. Uh, but of all the, of,
[647.50s -> 649.22s]  yeah, of all the like things I
[649.22s -> 650.70s]  probably could have and should have
[650.70s -> 652.26s]  and like people like called forward
[652.26s -> 654.02s]  to me to get, get disqualified
[654.02s -> 655.74s]  that year. We, we like disqual,
[655.74s -> 659.70s]  we, we, we decided that since it,
[659.70s -> 662.74s]  like, since that wasn't open to
[662.74s -> 664.02s]  all runners, I probably shouldn't
[664.02s -> 667.70s]  do that. And it was actually at
[667.70s -> 668.82s]  a spot where like, I didn't want
[668.82s -> 670.38s]  to stop anyways. Like, like I
[670.38s -> 671.54s]  lived around like, I think like
[671.54s -> 674.06s]  mile 90 or 95 and I wasn't
[674.06s -> 677.50s]  really wanting to stop until the
[677.50s -> 680.14s]  like 36 hour or like the, like
[681.06s -> 682.62s]  something like that. Like, yeah,
[683.02s -> 684.06s]  you know, I was running by the
[684.06s -> 686.26s]  house at like, you know, 20 to
[686.26s -> 688.26s]  24 hours and I didn't really
[688.26s -> 689.02s]  want to stop. They want to
[689.02s -> 690.74s]  lose that momentum. Um,
[690.94s -> 692.42s]  anyways, so it was like,
[692.86s -> 695.70s]  yeah, it was probably that,
[695.70s -> 697.62s]  but to be fair too, like
[697.62s -> 698.74s]  I've lived in Flagstaff
[698.74s -> 700.18s]  multiple times. I've like gone
[700.18s -> 702.10s]  to, I went to college in
[702.10s -> 703.34s]  Flagstaff. I lived in the
[703.34s -> 704.94s]  Verde Valley for a while. I
[704.94s -> 706.30s]  like worked on vineyards out
[706.30s -> 709.38s]  there for a little while. Um,
[710.46s -> 712.86s]  yeah, I grew up in Bradshaw's.
[712.90s -> 715.10s]  It's like, um, that whole
[715.10s -> 717.46s]  course is just like my, my
[717.78s -> 719.50s]  area, you know, it's like,
[721.02s -> 722.46s]  which I've talked quite a bit
[722.46s -> 723.82s]  about that, about how like
[723.82s -> 725.26s]  that is a sort of real
[725.30s -> 727.90s]  advantage. Yeah. Yeah. Always
[727.90s -> 729.50s]  knowing what's, what's ahead
[729.54s -> 730.86s]  and what's like coming up and
[730.86s -> 734.62s]  just like, um, yeah. And just
[734.62s -> 738.14s]  the sort of mental advantage
[738.14s -> 740.38s]  that gives you is like, you
[740.38s -> 742.06s]  know, and then also just like
[742.06s -> 743.22s]  being a local too, and like
[743.22s -> 744.74s]  people showing up on the
[744.74s -> 745.82s]  trail, like wanting to
[745.82s -> 747.62s]  support you and run with you.
[747.86s -> 750.10s]  Yeah. Yeah, that's amazing.
[750.94s -> 753.34s]  Yeah. What, um, I mean, how
[753.34s -> 754.30s]  do you think of yourself?
[754.30s -> 755.62s]  Like, I mean, when there's
[755.66s -> 757.06s]  you're sort of an intriguing
[757.74s -> 759.54s]  figure, like the satisfy
[759.54s -> 762.30s]  connection, you know, clearly
[762.58s -> 763.86s]  you do well in ultra races,
[763.86s -> 765.14s]  but even to hear you talk
[765.14s -> 766.06s]  about this upfront, like you
[766.06s -> 766.58s]  don't want to think of
[766.58s -> 769.10s]  yourself as, and I don't put
[769.10s -> 769.86s]  words in your mouth, but
[769.86s -> 770.66s]  something along the lines of
[770.66s -> 771.54s]  don't necessarily think of
[771.54s -> 774.10s]  yourself as this ultra runner,
[774.10s -> 775.58s]  so to speak in this unique
[775.58s -> 777.14s]  connection with this Paris
[777.22s -> 779.58s]  high end sort of trail
[779.58s -> 781.46s]  running brand. And then also,
[781.86s -> 782.94s]  you know, your name comes up
[782.94s -> 784.98s]  with, um, Salem Stanley at
[784.98s -> 786.14s]  vacation races that, you
[786.14s -> 787.38s]  know, you're kind of like
[787.38s -> 788.66s]  the, the night and shining
[788.66s -> 789.94s]  armor that just shows up and
[789.94s -> 790.98s]  marks a course through the
[790.98s -> 792.66s]  night and then comes down and
[792.66s -> 793.46s]  tears everything down. You're
[793.46s -> 795.54s]  sort of this interesting figure,
[796.02s -> 797.94s]  uh, how do you perceive
[797.94s -> 799.70s]  yourself? Like, I know that
[799.70s -> 800.78s]  you're also a builder or you
[800.78s -> 801.78s]  were a builder for a while.
[801.78s -> 803.06s]  He kind of, kind of got a lot,
[803.22s -> 804.38s]  a lot of stuff going on.
[805.90s -> 807.50s]  Yeah. I think I just get
[807.50s -> 809.54s]  bored easily. I think I,
[809.54s -> 810.58s]  like, I don't really do
[810.58s -> 811.94s]  things for very long. Like
[811.94s -> 812.82s]  I've had a lot of different
[812.82s -> 813.94s]  careers, you know, like I,
[815.18s -> 815.74s]  I don't know, I used to
[815.74s -> 817.10s]  teach chemistry and I worked
[817.10s -> 818.62s]  in a genetics lab for a long
[818.62s -> 819.90s]  time. Really? Yeah. I've
[819.90s -> 821.38s]  like built houses and I was
[821.42s -> 824.22s]  like, yeah. And then now this
[824.22s -> 827.26s]  like weird, you know, French
[827.94s -> 831.74s]  thing exists and like, and
[831.74s -> 832.82s]  just like running in general.
[833.10s -> 834.70s]  I think, I do think like
[834.70s -> 836.10s]  people aren't used to, I
[836.10s -> 837.70s]  think why people maybe find
[837.70s -> 838.70s]  that interesting about it
[838.70s -> 840.26s]  because I've, I've, you
[840.26s -> 844.62s]  know, I've had that said or
[844.62s -> 846.26s]  asked to me like before,
[846.34s -> 849.14s]  but like running is just not
[849.14s -> 850.22s]  the most important thing I
[850.22s -> 852.18s]  do. Yeah. It's just the
[852.18s -> 853.62s]  thing that I think I'm best
[853.62s -> 855.94s]  at or like, like I'm good
[855.94s -> 856.90s]  at it. So like I get
[856.90s -> 859.02s]  attention for it. Yeah. You
[859.02s -> 859.70s]  know what I mean? Like I'm
[859.70s -> 860.70s]  not a very good rock
[860.70s -> 861.66s]  climber. So like, I don't
[861.66s -> 862.58s]  get attention. Like no one
[862.58s -> 863.58s]  thinks I'm a rock climber
[863.58s -> 864.10s]  because I don't get
[864.10s -> 867.02s]  attention for it. But that
[867.02s -> 867.90s]  doesn't mean I don't do
[867.90s -> 869.38s]  that or it's just like, I
[869.38s -> 870.54s]  just like happen to kind of
[870.54s -> 872.54s]  be good at like suffering
[872.58s -> 873.90s]  all day. So it's like I
[873.90s -> 876.06s]  get attention for some stuff
[876.06s -> 877.98s]  that like, and, and to be
[877.98s -> 878.98s]  fair too, I mean, like
[878.98s -> 880.34s]  most people don't know me
[880.34s -> 881.34s]  personally, they just like
[881.34s -> 882.34s]  follow me online or
[882.34s -> 884.30s]  whatever. So it's like, and
[884.30s -> 885.86s]  like, I don't have like, I
[885.86s -> 886.98s]  don't share things about my
[886.98s -> 888.38s]  personal life online. So
[888.38s -> 889.50s]  like, why would anyone know
[889.50s -> 890.74s]  any of that other stuff? So
[890.74s -> 892.18s]  it's like, they're like,
[892.34s -> 894.10s]  like the social media
[894.14s -> 895.74s]  exists because of like,
[895.94s -> 897.90s]  because of, I mean,
[897.90s -> 899.10s]  satisfied doesn't care,
[899.10s -> 900.94s]  but previous like
[901.86s -> 903.62s]  contractual obligations to
[903.62s -> 904.86s]  like create content for
[904.86s -> 906.18s]  companies. And it's like,
[906.22s -> 909.90s]  yeah. So like, I only
[909.90s -> 911.54s]  post things about running on
[911.54s -> 912.82s]  there. So it's like, like, I
[912.82s -> 914.06s]  like, I don't, I don't, it's
[914.06s -> 915.02s]  not like I don't understand
[915.02s -> 916.22s]  why people think that I'm a
[916.22s -> 917.74s]  runner. That's all I share
[917.74s -> 918.78s]  like online. You know what
[918.78s -> 919.66s]  I mean? But it's like,
[920.10s -> 921.22s]  like, realistically, it's
[921.22s -> 922.34s]  yeah, it's like the fourth
[922.34s -> 923.62s]  thing I do or whatever.
[923.62s -> 924.58s]  You know, it's like, it's
[924.58s -> 926.70s]  not, it's not like this
[926.70s -> 927.86s]  huge. And to be fair, I
[927.86s -> 928.86s]  do think that's why I've
[928.86s -> 929.94s]  like never been that great
[929.94s -> 930.98s]  of an ultra runner. Like I
[930.98s -> 932.34s]  don't think I'm like, like
[932.38s -> 933.62s]  objectively speaking, like
[933.62s -> 936.10s]  I'm not like, I'm not that
[936.10s -> 937.42s]  fast. I'm not that like
[937.42s -> 938.62s]  crazy, but like I've gotten
[938.62s -> 939.94s]  attention for it. But, but
[940.18s -> 942.34s]  it's like, it's not, uh,
[943.34s -> 946.86s]  because I don't like, I
[946.86s -> 949.54s]  don't, I don't live a life
[949.54s -> 950.86s]  of a professional athlete,
[950.86s -> 952.10s]  even though like technically
[952.10s -> 953.62s]  you could say that, that
[953.62s -> 955.94s]  I am. It's like, I don't
[955.94s -> 957.54s]  live that lifestyle really.
[957.54s -> 959.38s]  Like I don't like, like I
[959.38s -> 960.22s]  don't have a training
[960.22s -> 961.38s]  schedule. I don't like, I
[961.38s -> 962.26s]  don't have a coach. I
[962.26s -> 963.34s]  don't have like any of
[963.34s -> 965.06s]  like, I don't like, I
[965.06s -> 966.46s]  don't do speed work. I
[966.46s -> 967.54s]  don't like, yeah. Like I
[967.54s -> 968.94s]  barely know what like a,
[969.82s -> 970.94s]  see, I'm going to even say
[970.94s -> 971.74s]  it like, like, what is it?
[971.74s -> 973.46s]  Like, like a fart lick or
[973.46s -> 976.50s]  whatever. Like I, like I
[976.50s -> 977.58s]  kind of know what that
[977.58s -> 978.58s]  is, but not really, you
[978.58s -> 979.22s]  know what I mean? It's
[979.22s -> 980.50s]  like, like I'm not a
[980.50s -> 982.14s]  runner. Like I, I just
[982.14s -> 983.22s]  like, and I'm not trying
[983.22s -> 984.34s]  to say anything bad about
[984.34s -> 985.22s]  that at all. It's like,
[985.38s -> 986.42s]  it's like not, it's just
[986.42s -> 988.14s]  like not my thing. It's
[988.14s -> 988.54s]  like,
[989.70s -> 990.34s]  yeah, there's, there's
[990.34s -> 992.02s]  something of like, uh, and
[992.02s -> 993.06s]  for lack of a better word,
[993.06s -> 994.30s]  like a Renaissance man sort
[994.30s -> 997.14s]  of vibe of, uh, you can
[997.14s -> 998.58s]  jump in a lot of things
[998.74s -> 1000.02s]  and handle yourself, you
[1000.02s -> 1001.46s]  know, in a lot of different
[1001.46s -> 1002.66s]  situations, but it just so
[1002.66s -> 1003.62s]  happens from a marketing
[1003.62s -> 1005.38s]  standpoint, I don't know
[1005.58s -> 1006.98s]  what came first, the
[1006.98s -> 1009.02s]  satisfy vibe or your vibe
[1009.22s -> 1010.10s]  or if it was just the
[1010.10s -> 1011.22s]  perfect fit, but it just
[1011.22s -> 1012.14s]  seems like the alignment
[1012.14s -> 1012.90s]  is so spot on.
[1013.30s -> 1013.98s]  I think it was just a
[1013.98s -> 1014.98s]  perfect fit. I mean,
[1014.98s -> 1018.50s]  he's like, I think so
[1018.54s -> 1019.34s]  kind of the famous
[1019.34s -> 1020.82s]  story with like me and
[1020.82s -> 1024.30s]  satisfy was like, um,
[1024.62s -> 1025.86s]  they had watched a
[1025.86s -> 1027.42s]  documentary that Jamil had
[1027.42s -> 1030.06s]  made about me. And like,
[1030.54s -> 1032.02s]  in that documentary, I
[1032.02s -> 1032.98s]  was wearing like a pearl
[1032.98s -> 1034.86s]  snap at like the whiskey
[1034.86s -> 1035.90s]  base and trail runs or
[1035.90s -> 1036.62s]  whatever. And it was
[1036.62s -> 1037.62s]  like, because they're
[1037.62s -> 1038.50s]  French, they're just
[1038.50s -> 1040.98s]  like, Ooh, like Western
[1041.78s -> 1042.82s]  kitchiness, you know,
[1042.82s -> 1045.78s]  and it's like, uh, so
[1045.78s -> 1046.54s]  they kind of reached
[1046.54s -> 1047.14s]  out and they were
[1047.14s -> 1048.02s]  looking to like, kind of
[1048.02s -> 1049.22s]  like bring on an athlete
[1049.22s -> 1050.46s]  for their first, like,
[1050.74s -> 1051.38s]  like, cause I was their
[1051.38s -> 1052.54s]  first athlete. So it was
[1052.54s -> 1053.50s]  like, they were kind of
[1053.50s -> 1054.58s]  looking to like get into
[1054.58s -> 1056.14s]  that area or whatever.
[1056.14s -> 1059.62s]  And, um, I think they
[1059.62s -> 1060.58s]  sort of like started some
[1060.58s -> 1061.94s]  initial conversations and
[1061.94s -> 1063.18s]  we were talking and like
[1063.18s -> 1064.46s]  my initial response was
[1064.46s -> 1065.70s]  like at that time in my
[1065.70s -> 1066.78s]  life, I had sworn off
[1066.78s -> 1067.54s]  ever working with a
[1067.54s -> 1068.62s]  company again. It's just
[1068.62s -> 1069.74s]  like, it's just not
[1069.74s -> 1070.62s]  worth it. And like
[1070.62s -> 1072.82s]  today, like in trail
[1072.82s -> 1073.98s]  running today, it's
[1073.98s -> 1075.38s]  like, there's a handful
[1075.38s -> 1076.26s]  of guys and girls like
[1076.26s -> 1077.42s]  making money at the top
[1077.42s -> 1078.30s]  and the rest are just
[1078.30s -> 1079.46s]  getting completely taken
[1079.46s -> 1080.62s]  advantage of my
[1080.62s -> 1082.14s]  companies. Yeah. But
[1082.14s -> 1082.86s]  it's like, for me, it
[1082.86s -> 1084.02s]  just wasn't, it just
[1084.34s -> 1086.10s]  like the, the, the
[1086.10s -> 1087.46s]  exchange wasn't trade off.
[1087.50s -> 1088.58s]  Yeah. It wasn't a fair
[1088.58s -> 1090.50s]  exchange. It's like, you
[1090.50s -> 1091.82s]  know, and so I had like
[1091.82s -> 1092.86s]  sworn off ever working
[1092.86s -> 1093.86s]  with a company again.
[1093.86s -> 1094.82s]  It's like, I should not
[1094.82s -> 1096.66s]  be a part of anyone's
[1096.66s -> 1098.02s]  marketing department. Like
[1098.06s -> 1099.02s]  I like, I'm just like,
[1099.10s -> 1100.54s]  you know, I, I'm too
[1100.54s -> 1101.58s]  honest. I'm too like
[1101.58s -> 1103.70s]  critical of things. Like
[1104.14s -> 1105.18s]  I just like, I shouldn't
[1105.18s -> 1106.82s]  be part of that. And,
[1107.42s -> 1110.14s]  um, and then, and then
[1110.14s -> 1111.14s]  like, to be honest, I
[1111.14s -> 1111.98s]  like started checking out
[1111.98s -> 1113.34s]  their website and like
[1113.34s -> 1114.10s]  the different things that
[1114.10s -> 1115.10s]  they do. And they had
[1115.10s -> 1116.98s]  like, uh, like Brice,
[1116.98s -> 1117.82s]  the owner of the company
[1117.82s -> 1118.62s]  is really good friends
[1118.62s -> 1119.74s]  with like Steven O'Malley,
[1119.74s -> 1120.98s]  who's like a pretty like
[1121.38s -> 1122.58s]  infamous character and
[1122.58s -> 1123.90s]  like drone metal music.
[1123.90s -> 1124.94s]  And he's like the
[1124.94s -> 1125.86s]  creator of the band,
[1125.86s -> 1128.14s]  Sun. Okay. A bunch of
[1128.14s -> 1129.18s]  like other things and
[1129.18s -> 1130.22s]  like, I'm like a really
[1130.22s -> 1131.74s]  big fan of them. And
[1131.74s -> 1132.78s]  they have like a long
[1132.78s -> 1134.10s]  interview with him like
[1134.10s -> 1135.50s]  up on their website. And
[1135.62s -> 1136.42s]  like, they have like
[1136.42s -> 1137.66s]  all this literature about
[1137.66s -> 1138.94s]  their whole like LSD
[1138.94s -> 1140.02s]  thing and like the long
[1140.02s -> 1141.46s]  slow distance and like
[1142.46s -> 1143.82s]  breaking psychedelics and
[1143.82s -> 1144.54s]  like blah, blah. And I
[1144.54s -> 1145.26s]  was just like, well, this
[1145.26s -> 1146.66s]  is fucking perfect. And
[1146.66s -> 1150.14s]  it's like, and, and I
[1150.14s -> 1151.42s]  think I, I think I sent
[1151.42s -> 1152.54s]  them a message back.
[1153.10s -> 1154.62s]  The message that now
[1154.62s -> 1155.66s]  like infamous message,
[1155.66s -> 1156.66s]  which I guess they like
[1156.66s -> 1157.46s]  printed out and like
[1157.46s -> 1158.46s]  hung up on their wall
[1158.46s -> 1159.70s]  in Paris was like
[1160.94s -> 1162.14s]  something to the effect
[1162.14s -> 1165.90s]  of like, of like, yeah,
[1165.90s -> 1166.54s]  I'm probably not going
[1166.54s -> 1167.62s]  to like win any races
[1167.62s -> 1168.62s]  or do like any social
[1168.62s -> 1169.78s]  media for you guys. But
[1169.78s -> 1170.94s]  if all you need me to
[1170.94s -> 1172.02s]  do is like, listen to
[1172.02s -> 1173.78s]  do metal, do psychedelics
[1173.78s -> 1175.02s]  and design pearl snaps
[1175.02s -> 1176.62s]  for you guys, like, like
[1177.10s -> 1178.38s]  I can probably crush
[1178.38s -> 1179.62s]  that one for once in
[1179.62s -> 1180.66s]  my life, like live up
[1180.66s -> 1182.46s]  to my contractual
[1182.46s -> 1184.18s]  obligation. You know
[1184.18s -> 1186.10s]  what I mean? Whereas
[1186.10s -> 1186.70s]  I feel like most
[1186.70s -> 1187.34s]  companies would have been
[1187.34s -> 1188.02s]  like, what the fuck?
[1188.02s -> 1188.82s]  Like, who's this guy?
[1188.82s -> 1189.46s]  Like, you know what I
[1189.46s -> 1191.10s]  mean? Like, it's
[1191.10s -> 1192.54s]  perfect. Not only were
[1192.54s -> 1194.58s]  they like, okay, but I
[1194.58s -> 1195.58s]  think that was for
[1195.58s -> 1196.42s]  them. Like this is
[1196.42s -> 1198.10s]  clearly our guy. You
[1198.10s -> 1200.42s]  know, and, and then
[1200.42s -> 1201.34s]  like a month later, I
[1201.34s -> 1202.70s]  won coca-dona and just
[1202.70s -> 1203.82s]  like, boom, satisfies
[1203.82s -> 1205.54s]  that. Yeah. It's like,
[1205.54s -> 1206.38s]  so for them, I think
[1206.38s -> 1207.38s]  it was great for me.
[1207.38s -> 1208.70s]  It's great. I think
[1208.70s -> 1209.50s]  I have the best deal
[1209.50s -> 1210.42s]  in ultra running. I mean,
[1210.42s -> 1211.02s]  I know a lot of
[1211.02s -> 1212.14s]  athletes. I know a lot
[1212.14s -> 1214.26s]  of, and like, um,
[1214.26s -> 1216.46s]  I know their involvement
[1216.46s -> 1217.18s]  with the companies
[1217.18s -> 1217.86s]  that there nature of
[1217.86s -> 1218.94s]  the contract. Yeah.
[1218.94s -> 1221.26s]  And, and for what
[1221.26s -> 1224.10s]  I have to do for it,
[1224.10s -> 1224.74s]  I think I have the
[1224.74s -> 1225.58s]  best deal in ultra.
[1225.58s -> 1226.18s]  I mean, I don't make
[1226.18s -> 1227.06s]  that much money. It's
[1227.06s -> 1228.06s]  like, it's not crazy,
[1228.06s -> 1229.22s]  but it's like, it's
[1229.34s -> 1230.70s]  just like for ease and,
[1230.70s -> 1231.46s]  and just like my
[1231.46s -> 1232.62s]  psychological health,
[1232.62s -> 1233.22s]  you know what I mean?
[1233.22s -> 1234.58s]  It's like, yeah, that
[1234.58s -> 1235.38s]  that's a big thing
[1235.38s -> 1236.78s]  about like the, the,
[1236.78s -> 1238.58s]  the relationship that
[1238.58s -> 1240.06s]  typically exact exists
[1240.06s -> 1240.98s]  between athletes and
[1240.98s -> 1241.78s]  their companies is
[1241.78s -> 1242.94s]  like, for me,
[1242.94s -> 1243.94s]  psychologically, I'm
[1243.94s -> 1244.94s]  not capable of doing
[1244.94s -> 1245.66s]  that. Like I'm not
[1245.66s -> 1246.98s]  capable of every
[1246.98s -> 1247.90s]  single time I step
[1247.90s -> 1250.26s]  foot outdoors. It's
[1250.26s -> 1251.18s]  feeling like I need
[1251.18s -> 1251.78s]  to like create
[1251.78s -> 1252.94s]  content capture. Yeah.
[1252.94s -> 1254.62s]  Like this exists for
[1254.62s -> 1255.82s]  social media or this
[1255.82s -> 1257.18s]  exists for this or
[1257.18s -> 1258.34s]  that. And I don't
[1258.34s -> 1258.98s]  have to do any of
[1258.98s -> 1260.30s]  that. So I just have
[1260.30s -> 1262.70s]  to like, yeah, I
[1262.70s -> 1263.54s]  mean, it's a perfect
[1263.54s -> 1265.06s]  lesson because I talk
[1265.06s -> 1266.02s]  about it a lot. It's
[1266.02s -> 1266.90s]  not totally on brand
[1266.90s -> 1267.54s]  with like what I'm
[1267.54s -> 1268.86s]  building to, to
[1268.86s -> 1269.78s]  like bring critiques
[1269.78s -> 1270.54s]  to the industry,
[1270.54s -> 1271.90s]  like, but the
[1271.90s -> 1273.22s]  thing that I often
[1273.22s -> 1274.74s]  talk to other athletes
[1274.74s -> 1275.34s]  and stuff about is
[1275.34s -> 1276.14s]  that, you know,
[1276.14s -> 1276.74s]  as an athlete,
[1276.74s -> 1277.98s]  you're a, you're
[1277.98s -> 1279.26s]  an, like a marketing
[1279.26s -> 1280.74s]  expense. And if
[1280.74s -> 1281.42s]  you're not generating
[1281.42s -> 1283.94s]  revenue, and oftentimes
[1283.94s -> 1284.42s]  that pressure to
[1284.42s -> 1285.18s]  generate revenue has
[1285.18s -> 1285.98s]  to do with performance
[1285.98s -> 1286.78s]  in a race or, you
[1286.78s -> 1287.98s]  know, surrounding
[1287.98s -> 1290.22s]  content. What I
[1290.22s -> 1290.94s]  like about what I
[1290.94s -> 1291.54s]  see with you and
[1291.54s -> 1292.30s]  Satisfy is that
[1292.30s -> 1293.42s]  like, it feels
[1293.42s -> 1295.62s]  like it's a, the
[1295.62s -> 1296.42s]  just back to that
[1296.42s -> 1297.10s]  thing, the alignment
[1297.10s -> 1298.22s]  is so good between
[1298.22s -> 1300.42s]  you and them that
[1300.42s -> 1301.38s]  like it seems like
[1301.38s -> 1301.94s]  it's a natural
[1301.94s -> 1302.90s]  expression just based
[1302.90s -> 1303.38s]  off the short
[1303.38s -> 1304.10s]  conversation we've
[1304.10s -> 1304.62s]  had. Like it's
[1304.62s -> 1305.18s]  like a natural
[1305.18s -> 1306.22s]  expression. It feels
[1306.22s -> 1307.34s]  authentic. Like the
[1307.34s -> 1307.86s]  content that's
[1307.86s -> 1308.58s]  coming out on
[1308.58s -> 1309.98s]  Satisfy's side
[1309.98s -> 1310.42s]  feels like an
[1310.42s -> 1311.82s]  authentic, like
[1311.82s -> 1313.34s]  legit connection.
[1313.34s -> 1314.06s]  Would you agree
[1314.06s -> 1316.42s]  with that? Yeah,
[1316.42s -> 1316.78s]  I mean, it
[1316.78s -> 1317.54s]  wouldn't exist
[1317.54s -> 1318.26s]  if it wasn't, you
[1318.26s -> 1321.26s]  know, it's like it,
[1321.26s -> 1322.34s]  it just wouldn't exist.
[1322.34s -> 1323.02s]  It wouldn't work
[1323.02s -> 1323.94s]  if it wasn't that.
[1323.94s -> 1325.14s]  So it's like,
[1325.14s -> 1325.86s]  and I mean, that's
[1325.86s -> 1326.70s]  why, again, why
[1326.70s -> 1327.42s]  we agreed to work
[1327.42s -> 1327.94s]  together in the
[1327.94s -> 1328.74s]  first place. And
[1328.74s -> 1329.74s]  it's like we
[1329.74s -> 1330.94s]  could, and then
[1330.94s -> 1331.66s]  on top of that,
[1331.66s -> 1332.34s]  I mean, it's
[1332.34s -> 1332.98s]  such a huge
[1332.98s -> 1333.82s]  thing that goes
[1333.82s -> 1335.22s]  like under value
[1335.22s -> 1335.94s]  or whatever. But
[1335.94s -> 1337.42s]  like I, like
[1337.42s -> 1338.14s]  Brice and I have
[1338.14s -> 1338.90s]  just become really
[1338.90s -> 1340.02s]  good friends, like
[1340.02s -> 1340.58s]  the owner of the
[1340.58s -> 1341.30s]  company, like he
[1341.30s -> 1342.70s]  and I are like,
[1342.70s -> 1343.58s]  it's like I asked
[1343.58s -> 1344.46s]  him to be like
[1344.46s -> 1345.34s]  the godfather of
[1345.34s -> 1346.30s]  my baby, you know,
[1346.94s -> 1347.98s]  and it's like, I don't
[1347.98s -> 1349.34s]  like I asked him
[1349.34s -> 1350.10s]  that not knowing
[1350.10s -> 1351.90s]  what a godfather is.
[1351.90s -> 1354.22s]  Really, I was like,
[1354.22s -> 1355.22s]  I was like, oh,
[1355.22s -> 1355.70s]  you're just
[1355.70s -> 1356.74s]  even better for
[1356.74s -> 1357.90s]  the spiritual upbringing
[1357.90s -> 1358.66s]  of my child.
[1358.66s -> 1359.58s]  We're all like
[1359.58s -> 1360.58s]  pagan heathens,
[1360.58s -> 1361.46s]  you know, and it's like,
[1361.46s -> 1361.98s]  well, you're
[1361.98s -> 1362.98s]  you're now responsible
[1362.98s -> 1364.26s]  for the yeah.
[1364.26s -> 1366.86s]  And it's like, yeah.
[1366.86s -> 1367.62s]  But no, I mean,
[1367.62s -> 1368.26s]  it's just like
[1368.26s -> 1369.02s]  they're just really
[1369.02s -> 1369.90s]  awesome people.
[1369.90s -> 1370.38s]  And we have like
[1370.38s -> 1371.14s]  similar interests
[1371.14s -> 1371.86s]  like Brice was here
[1371.86s -> 1372.46s]  the last day when
[1372.46s -> 1373.22s]  just like played
[1373.22s -> 1374.10s]  like metal music
[1374.10s -> 1374.90s]  in my garage
[1374.90s -> 1376.18s]  and like hanging out
[1376.18s -> 1377.42s]  and like we're actually
[1377.42s -> 1378.10s]  friends, you know.
[1378.10s -> 1379.06s]  And so it's like
[1379.06s -> 1379.78s]  I think that goes
[1379.78s -> 1380.82s]  under value is like
[1380.82s -> 1381.82s]  you're just
[1381.82s -> 1383.14s]  a nice person,
[1383.14s -> 1383.86s]  like you're just like
[1383.86s -> 1385.34s]  a nice and caring person.
[1385.34s -> 1386.42s]  And I think that
[1386.42s -> 1387.86s]  that goes both ways.
[1387.86s -> 1388.54s]  You know, I think
[1388.54s -> 1389.74s]  sounds like it's hit
[1389.74s -> 1390.66s]  up by a lot of like
[1390.66s -> 1392.78s]  actually good runners.
[1392.78s -> 1393.94s]  So like, you know,
[1393.94s -> 1394.74s]  like potentially
[1394.74s -> 1395.50s]  be an athlete
[1395.50s -> 1396.78s]  and they're like,
[1396.78s -> 1397.22s]  well, you don't
[1397.22s -> 1399.78s]  seem that nice, you know.
[1399.78s -> 1400.22s]  And it's like
[1400.22s -> 1401.22s]  being a nice person
[1401.22s -> 1402.18s]  is like, you know,
[1402.18s -> 1402.98s]  goes a long way.
[1402.98s -> 1404.42s]  I'm full like
[1404.42s -> 1406.14s]  and so it's just like
[1407.14s -> 1408.06s]  like, you know,
[1408.06s -> 1409.90s]  I think sport in general,
[1409.90s -> 1410.94s]  there's a lot of ego
[1410.94s -> 1412.34s]  and there's a lot of like,
[1412.34s -> 1413.62s]  you know, that exists.
[1413.62s -> 1417.06s]  And so I think for myself
[1417.06s -> 1418.54s]  and a brand like satisfied
[1418.54s -> 1419.42s]  to like carve out
[1419.42s -> 1420.94s]  a little market for ourselves
[1420.94s -> 1423.74s]  is like, you know,
[1423.74s -> 1424.26s]  it's great.
[1424.26s -> 1425.66s]  And I don't think
[1425.66s -> 1426.66s]  it's abnormal, you know,
[1426.66s -> 1427.94s]  like 99% of people
[1427.94s -> 1430.58s]  who run are not.
[1430.58s -> 1432.46s]  Like what is perceived
[1432.46s -> 1434.10s]  as like an ultra runner,
[1434.10s -> 1435.30s]  like 99% of people
[1435.30s -> 1437.90s]  who run aren't ultra runners.
[1437.90s -> 1438.78s]  They're not like
[1438.78s -> 1440.70s]  attractive model
[1440.70s -> 1442.86s]  Instagrammers, you know,
[1442.86s -> 1443.98s]  or like Solomon
[1443.98s -> 1445.46s]  athletes or like
[1445.46s -> 1446.90s]  or like Hoka
[1446.90s -> 1448.70s]  college, like D1 athlete.
[1448.70s -> 1449.98s]  It's like the majority
[1449.98s -> 1450.70s]  of people who run
[1450.70s -> 1451.46s]  are not that.
[1451.46s -> 1452.14s]  And so it's like,
[1452.14s -> 1453.38s]  you know, I think me
[1453.38s -> 1454.74s]  and satisfy a lot of time
[1454.74s -> 1455.62s]  get labeled as being
[1455.62s -> 1456.70s]  my counterculture.
[1456.70s -> 1458.46s]  And it's like.
[1458.46s -> 1459.26s]  No, fuck that,
[1459.26s -> 1460.82s]  like that's the counterculture
[1460.82s -> 1462.06s]  like I am American
[1462.06s -> 1463.02s]  ultra running,
[1463.02s -> 1463.62s]  you know what I mean?
[1463.62s -> 1464.46s]  Absolutely.
[1464.46s -> 1466.42s]  And it's like an idea
[1466.42s -> 1467.94s]  of like these college kids
[1467.94s -> 1468.74s]  coming in again,
[1468.74s -> 1469.62s]  I'm not trying to like
[1469.62s -> 1470.78s]  talk shit about those kids,
[1470.78s -> 1471.94s]  but the idea of like
[1471.94s -> 1472.90s]  these kids coming in
[1472.90s -> 1473.74s]  and like throwing down
[1473.74s -> 1474.66s]  these like insane
[1474.66s -> 1475.90s]  like marathon times
[1475.90s -> 1477.34s]  and like like money
[1477.34s -> 1478.14s]  and athletes
[1478.14s -> 1479.30s]  and like professional
[1479.30s -> 1481.30s]  athlete sports like that.
[1481.30s -> 1482.18s]  That's the fucking
[1482.18s -> 1483.18s]  counterculture.
[1483.18s -> 1484.54s]  Yeah, you know what I mean?
[1484.54s -> 1486.90s]  And so, yeah, I think
[1486.90s -> 1488.30s]  what I love about America
[1488.30s -> 1489.78s]  ultra running,
[1489.78s -> 1491.38s]  you know, by by contrast,
[1491.38s -> 1492.78s]  is that I mean,
[1492.78s -> 1493.74s]  I just are practically
[1493.74s -> 1494.66s]  speaking, our permits
[1494.66s -> 1496.46s]  don't allow for,
[1496.46s -> 1497.54s]  let's say, UTMB
[1497.54s -> 1498.50s]  size starting line.
[1498.50s -> 1499.46s]  Like, you know,
[1499.46s -> 1500.22s]  I mean, it seems like
[1500.22s -> 1501.50s]  our Viper has some
[1501.50s -> 1503.10s]  pretty legit size,
[1503.10s -> 1504.06s]  but still like New York
[1504.06s -> 1506.34s]  Marathons, 50,000 people.
[1506.34s -> 1507.18s]  So a big trail race
[1507.18s -> 1508.34s]  would still be a thousand.
[1508.34s -> 1509.02s]  But, you know,
[1509.02s -> 1511.02s]  the Western States,
[1511.02s -> 1512.30s]  300 people are,
[1512.30s -> 1513.10s]  you know, even Zion,
[1513.10s -> 1515.22s]  I think he keeps those down
[1515.22s -> 1516.38s]  100 mile or that
[1516.38s -> 1517.10s]  the whole Zion thing,
[1517.10s -> 1517.62s]  I think, is sub
[1517.62s -> 1519.94s]  1200 people or so for them
[1519.94s -> 1520.82s]  for like all seven
[1520.82s -> 1521.82s]  distances or whatever.
[1521.82s -> 1522.94s]  So I do feel like that's
[1523.82s -> 1526.46s]  uniquely American thing.
[1526.46s -> 1529.46s]  Yeah, yeah, the.
[1529.46s -> 1532.14s]  Yeah, vacation races is weird.
[1532.14s -> 1533.26s]  They were you buddies
[1533.26s -> 1533.86s]  with Matt Gunn,
[1533.86s -> 1535.54s]  do you go way back?
[1535.54s -> 1537.38s]  Yes, that's why I work there.
[1537.38s -> 1539.98s]  OK, is so I started
[1539.98s -> 1541.98s]  working with Matt.
[1543.46s -> 1545.82s]  And then.
[1545.82s -> 1546.50s]  Stayed on,
[1546.50s -> 1547.46s]  Matt stayed on
[1547.46s -> 1549.70s]  with vacation races,
[1549.70s -> 1551.90s]  I think for two years.
[1551.90s -> 1552.74s]  It felt like he was there
[1552.74s -> 1554.34s]  for two years, still just like
[1554.34s -> 1555.10s]  helping and like
[1555.10s -> 1556.38s]  doing the zero waste thing
[1556.38s -> 1557.94s]  and like doing all that.
[1557.94s -> 1558.66s]  Yeah.
[1558.66s -> 1561.26s]  And then he him
[1561.90s -> 1562.98s]  him myself and like
[1562.98s -> 1564.58s]  Steve Alderholt,
[1564.58s -> 1566.02s]  the RD of Cocodono,
[1566.02s -> 1566.58s]  we were planning
[1566.58s -> 1567.62s]  the Grand Staircase,
[1567.62s -> 1569.82s]  like multi-stage day race.
[1569.82s -> 1570.58s]  Yeah.
[1570.58s -> 1572.06s]  And then Matt left.
[1572.06s -> 1574.62s]  Yeah. But.
[1574.62s -> 1576.58s]  But yeah, I think I am
[1576.58s -> 1578.82s]  I after Tana left,
[1578.82s -> 1580.10s]  Tana left like a year
[1580.10s -> 1580.78s]  or two ago,
[1580.78s -> 1582.18s]  I think I'm the last holdout
[1582.18s -> 1583.74s]  from the Matt Gunn era.
[1583.74s -> 1584.42s]  OK.
[1584.42s -> 1587.70s]  And even even recently, Lyle,
[1587.70s -> 1588.78s]  I don't know if you know Lyle,
[1588.78s -> 1591.50s]  Lyle Anderson, Lyle left.
[1591.50s -> 1591.70s]  Yep.
[1591.70s -> 1593.30s]  And Lyle was the only person
[1593.30s -> 1594.90s]  that I dealt with at vacation races.
[1594.90s -> 1596.14s]  Oh, OK.
[1596.14s -> 1597.94s]  And so this year
[1597.94s -> 1599.46s]  is a little bit up in the air
[1599.46s -> 1600.06s]  of whether or not
[1600.06s -> 1601.74s]  I'm going to continue to be there
[1601.74s -> 1603.62s]  to mark to even mark the courses.
[1603.62s -> 1604.86s]  But I think I think
[1604.86s -> 1605.90s]  I'm figuring it out
[1605.90s -> 1607.50s]  how to still work there
[1607.50s -> 1610.10s]  and not be too.
[1610.34s -> 1613.18s]  It's just sort of existing
[1613.18s -> 1614.54s]  is like I'm almost
[1614.54s -> 1615.34s]  I've almost created
[1615.34s -> 1616.42s]  a third party trail
[1616.42s -> 1617.86s]  marking company at this point.
[1617.86s -> 1619.18s]  Yeah.
[1619.18s -> 1620.54s]  Where it's like vacation
[1620.54s -> 1621.78s]  races is hiring me
[1621.78s -> 1622.78s]  to mark their trails,
[1622.78s -> 1623.54s]  but I'm not really
[1623.54s -> 1624.86s]  involved with them.
[1624.86s -> 1625.58s]  Yeah.
[1625.58s -> 1626.70s]  I mean, I'm like
[1626.70s -> 1627.78s]  this separate entity
[1627.78s -> 1628.74s]  that like shows up,
[1628.74s -> 1630.18s]  marks, sweeps,
[1630.18s -> 1632.38s]  and they barely even know.
[1632.38s -> 1633.14s]  Yeah, you're just there
[1633.14s -> 1634.14s]  in the dark of night.
[1634.14s -> 1634.46s]  Yeah.
[1634.46s -> 1636.30s]  And it's like this person.
[1636.30s -> 1637.78s]  That was great with Lyle.
[1637.78s -> 1639.22s]  It worked really well with Lyle.
[1639.22s -> 1641.18s]  I don't know the dynamics moving forward.
[1641.18s -> 1642.38s]  I don't know the new guy.
[1642.38s -> 1643.50s]  You know, yeah, yeah.
[1643.50s -> 1644.54s]  I don't I don't either.
[1644.54s -> 1645.90s]  And it's like,
[1645.90s -> 1646.98s]  so, yeah, we'll see
[1646.98s -> 1647.86s]  what happens.
[1647.86s -> 1648.22s]  Yeah.
[1648.22s -> 1649.94s]  I mean, I we we just put on
[1649.94s -> 1651.82s]  like a 100 person 50K
[1651.82s -> 1653.54s]  up here in the Salt Lake Foothills
[1653.54s -> 1656.46s]  and marking is my least favorite
[1657.38s -> 1658.10s]  to put together.
[1658.10s -> 1659.26s]  So we should talk
[1659.26s -> 1660.06s]  if you ever want to come up here
[1660.06s -> 1661.10s]  and mark a course.
[1661.10s -> 1661.74s]  OK, yeah.
[1661.74s -> 1662.66s]  No, I like it.
[1662.66s -> 1663.86s]  I mean, I think of all the ways
[1663.86s -> 1665.38s]  to like earn a paycheck.
[1665.38s -> 1668.34s]  It's like, yeah, you know, totally.
[1669.02s -> 1669.74s]  It almost feels like
[1669.74s -> 1671.14s]  I like show up to a race
[1671.14s -> 1672.22s]  and I like don't ever
[1672.22s -> 1673.50s]  I don't have to run very hard,
[1673.50s -> 1675.78s]  but I still get the like winning prize.
[1677.70s -> 1678.78s]  Yeah.
[1678.78s -> 1680.78s]  One more thought on satisfy you.
[1680.78s -> 1681.82s]  So I lived in Paris
[1681.82s -> 1683.10s]  for a while and we're
[1683.10s -> 1685.18s]  looking to move back there.
[1685.18s -> 1687.26s]  My final my final thought on satisfy
[1687.26s -> 1688.78s]  and in your relationship with them
[1688.78s -> 1691.22s]  is I what I love about
[1691.22s -> 1694.02s]  French people is that niceness.
[1694.02s -> 1695.74s]  And sometimes they can get
[1695.74s -> 1697.34s]  a reputation
[1697.34s -> 1699.34s]  for being short or not very nice.
[1699.34s -> 1700.34s]  But what I do like
[1700.34s -> 1701.22s]  is when you come across someone
[1701.22s -> 1702.46s]  coming from like the rudest
[1702.46s -> 1703.94s]  culture in the world.
[1703.94s -> 1705.86s]  Yeah, yeah, fair.
[1705.86s -> 1709.02s]  But when the if you know,
[1709.02s -> 1711.18s]  in French culture, if you spend
[1711.18s -> 1712.10s]  you got to spend some time
[1712.10s -> 1713.74s]  before the conversation starts
[1713.74s -> 1715.22s]  saying hello and acknowledging
[1715.22s -> 1716.66s]  certain things about that,
[1716.66s -> 1718.90s]  we might diminish a small talk,
[1719.70s -> 1721.42s]  but you have these niceties
[1721.42s -> 1722.42s]  and these nice exchange
[1722.42s -> 1724.62s]  and you slowly ease into a conversation
[1724.62s -> 1726.30s]  as opposed to, you know,
[1726.30s -> 1728.50s]  just business get in and get out.
[1728.50s -> 1729.70s]  And so when you have
[1729.70s -> 1730.86s]  conversations on that level
[1730.86s -> 1731.46s]  and it sounds like this
[1731.46s -> 1732.30s]  is what you're identifying
[1732.30s -> 1733.54s]  with Brice is that like
[1733.54s -> 1734.30s]  there's just this
[1734.30s -> 1736.02s]  there's a deep kindness, you know,
[1736.02s -> 1737.98s]  and a great really connection
[1737.98s -> 1740.78s]  between Americans and French people.
[1740.78s -> 1742.94s]  If we meet each other on that level.
[1742.94s -> 1744.78s]  Yeah, and I mean,
[1744.78s -> 1747.30s]  I think, too, with with satisfy
[1747.30s -> 1749.74s]  and Brice and
[1749.74s -> 1750.54s]  Brice has a very
[1750.54s -> 1752.06s]  like obsessive personality,
[1752.06s -> 1752.74s]  like when he like
[1752.74s -> 1754.66s]  gets into something he like he'll
[1754.66s -> 1756.66s]  he like devotes his entire life to it.
[1756.66s -> 1758.78s]  And so like when he.
[1759.46s -> 1761.30s]  Like he does,
[1761.30s -> 1763.42s]  he's not coming from a place of like,
[1763.42s -> 1765.18s]  oh, like he's identified
[1765.18s -> 1766.94s]  this like space in the market
[1766.94s -> 1768.10s]  that they can exploit,
[1768.10s -> 1770.26s]  you know what I mean or whatever.
[1770.26s -> 1772.78s]  It's like, yeah, like
[1772.78s -> 1773.94s]  when Brice says
[1773.94s -> 1775.10s]  that he wants to sponsor
[1775.10s -> 1777.74s]  Coco Dona, like he
[1777.74s -> 1779.38s]  he pours all of his money
[1779.38s -> 1782.06s]  and all of his energy into
[1782.06s -> 1783.54s]  making that race
[1783.54s -> 1784.54s]  like a better race,
[1784.54s -> 1786.70s]  like he wants he wants to build that race
[1786.70s -> 1787.82s]  and he wants to make it
[1787.82s -> 1789.50s]  a better experience for runners
[1789.50s -> 1790.46s]  and a better experience
[1790.46s -> 1791.86s]  for everyone involved.
[1791.86s -> 1793.78s]  And he actually just like
[1793.78s -> 1794.94s]  when he says that he wants
[1794.94s -> 1796.26s]  to support athletes
[1796.26s -> 1797.98s]  or he wants to support races
[1797.98s -> 1799.58s]  or like he wants to like build
[1799.58s -> 1800.94s]  these like different cultures,
[1800.94s -> 1803.10s]  like many cultures around
[1803.10s -> 1804.18s]  and like actually support.
[1804.18s -> 1806.10s]  Like that's what he actually wants to do.
[1806.10s -> 1808.30s]  It's not about like identifying markets
[1808.30s -> 1809.94s]  and extracting from that market.
[1809.94s -> 1811.46s]  It's not like Brice is like
[1811.46s -> 1812.82s]  there's enough of a market here
[1812.82s -> 1814.66s]  that we can like plug in some numbers
[1814.66s -> 1817.30s]  and like this makes sense for us.
[1817.30s -> 1818.58s]  Yeah, it's like
[1818.58s -> 1819.82s]  I think being involved
[1819.82s -> 1822.14s]  with people like that who are like
[1822.14s -> 1823.38s]  I think that's why he like
[1823.38s -> 1825.70s]  he doesn't actually care very much
[1825.70s -> 1826.74s]  if I'm like living up
[1826.74s -> 1827.78s]  to my end of the bargain,
[1827.78s -> 1829.58s]  which is nice as defeat,
[1829.58s -> 1831.26s]  not have to like feel that pressure
[1831.26s -> 1832.90s]  as an athlete to like constantly
[1832.90s -> 1834.78s]  like be either like performing
[1834.78s -> 1836.62s]  that he actually just wants to support me
[1836.62s -> 1837.86s]  in anything that I do.
[1837.86s -> 1838.58s]  You know what I mean?
[1838.58s -> 1839.70s]  And it's like he actually wants
[1839.70s -> 1842.34s]  to just support things
[1842.34s -> 1843.82s]  and like, you know, satisfy gets like
[1843.82s -> 1845.86s]  a bad rap for being expensive or whatever.
[1845.86s -> 1846.98s]  But it's like, you know,
[1846.98s -> 1847.74s]  I mean, there are
[1847.74s -> 1849.18s]  that's a whole nother conversation
[1849.18s -> 1851.70s]  about like why things are expensive.
[1851.70s -> 1853.90s]  Yeah, like why nice things are expensive.
[1853.90s -> 1856.30s]  But it's like
[1856.30s -> 1858.26s]  but it's also like
[1858.26s -> 1859.62s]  I just feel like
[1859.62s -> 1860.66s]  if you're a consumer,
[1860.66s -> 1862.10s]  you can just like feel a lot better.
[1862.10s -> 1863.34s]  Like, you know, like like Brice
[1863.34s -> 1865.94s]  isn't like some like crazy, like
[1865.94s -> 1867.62s]  corporate CEO, you know,
[1867.62s -> 1869.42s]  like, you know what I mean?
[1869.42s -> 1870.82s]  He's like, you know,
[1870.82s -> 1872.90s]  he's like down in the mud
[1872.90s -> 1874.30s]  on Saturday and Sunday,
[1874.30s -> 1876.90s]  like hiring, like spending like
[1876.90s -> 1878.78s]  God ungodly amounts of money
[1878.78s -> 1880.90s]  to like bring country bands
[1880.90s -> 1881.94s]  to the aid station
[1881.94s -> 1883.22s]  just to like make it cool.
[1883.22s -> 1883.94s]  You know what I mean?
[1883.94s -> 1885.26s]  And it's like, yeah,
[1885.26s -> 1886.34s]  I think French people are good
[1886.34s -> 1887.66s]  at playing the long game
[1887.66s -> 1890.10s]  compared to, you know, us in America,
[1890.10s -> 1891.62s]  where we maybe want quicker results.
[1891.62s -> 1893.66s]  I think the pace of life
[1893.66s -> 1895.34s]  in France is a little bit slower
[1895.34s -> 1896.58s]  and sometimes it can be faster.
[1896.58s -> 1898.54s]  But by and large, there's a
[1898.54s -> 1899.98s]  there's a longer term vision.
[1899.98s -> 1900.94s]  We don't have to get in.
[1900.94s -> 1902.50s]  You don't get a return in 12 months.
[1902.50s -> 1903.50s]  Like you dig in,
[1903.50s -> 1904.86s]  you build something for the long term
[1904.86s -> 1905.98s]  and you think about building it
[1905.98s -> 1907.02s]  in a way that you pass it on
[1907.02s -> 1909.34s]  to your next generation.
[1909.34s -> 1911.02s]  Yeah, so, yeah, I feel
[1911.02s -> 1912.18s]  I feel really spoiled,
[1912.18s -> 1913.62s]  you know, and lucky to be involved.
[1913.62s -> 1914.98s]  I mean, I don't know how it really
[1914.98s -> 1916.94s]  it worked out that way.
[1919.02s -> 1920.10s]  Well, what about saddles?
[1920.10s -> 1922.90s]  Is saddles a satisfied race
[1922.90s -> 1925.54s]  or is that a Michael Versteeg race?
[1925.54s -> 1926.94s]  Yeah, it's my race.
[1926.94s -> 1929.14s]  I mean, it it but
[1929.78s -> 1932.54s]  it exists as a race for
[1932.54s -> 1934.14s]  satisfy to
[1936.22s -> 1938.30s]  be involved in or encouraged
[1938.30s -> 1940.26s]  to grow in a specific way.
[1940.26s -> 1941.94s]  However, like they sort of
[1941.94s -> 1943.54s]  like it's like a it's like a.
[1945.46s -> 1948.06s]  You know, it's like a canvas for them
[1948.06s -> 1950.58s]  to like explore new ideas
[1950.58s -> 1952.10s]  and new things that trail running,
[1952.10s -> 1953.66s]  you know, and that's
[1953.66s -> 1954.82s]  I have no idea what's
[1954.82s -> 1955.98s]  going to happen with saddles
[1955.98s -> 1958.10s]  like over the next like few years.
[1959.94s -> 1960.54s]  Now.
[1962.22s -> 1963.82s]  I think right now it's just a really
[1963.82s -> 1964.62s]  like dirty.
[1965.54s -> 1967.30s]  Like grassroots trail run
[1967.30s -> 1968.26s]  around Prescott,
[1968.26s -> 1969.54s]  and that's what it was last year
[1969.54s -> 1970.74s]  and that's what it is this year,
[1970.74s -> 1971.46s]  but it's like.
[1973.30s -> 1974.90s]  And I think it's why Jamil
[1974.90s -> 1976.74s]  is also like so interested
[1976.74s -> 1978.54s]  in saddles and so interested
[1978.54s -> 1979.74s]  in satisfy like
[1980.94s -> 1982.42s]  like Aerovipa just became like
[1982.42s -> 1983.14s]  actually, I don't know
[1983.14s -> 1984.18s]  if I'm allowed to say this,
[1984.18s -> 1986.58s]  but whatever Aerovipa
[1986.58s -> 1988.42s]  just became like
[1988.42s -> 1990.86s]  like an investor and satisfy nice.
[1990.86s -> 1993.18s]  So like it's like there's this
[1993.18s -> 1994.90s]  and I think that all of that.
[1996.10s -> 1997.22s]  You know, can be expressed
[1997.22s -> 1997.90s]  in different ways,
[1997.90s -> 1999.54s]  but like sort of turning saddles
[1999.54s -> 2000.98s]  into this like different idea
[2000.98s -> 2002.46s]  of what a trail run can be.
[2002.46s -> 2003.70s]  And like things that you do
[2003.70s -> 2005.58s]  at trail runs like
[2005.58s -> 2006.50s]  it's not to show up,
[2006.50s -> 2007.58s]  get your bib, run the race
[2007.58s -> 2008.46s]  and go home.
[2008.46s -> 2010.18s]  You know, it's like, yeah.
[2010.18s -> 2012.10s]  So again, I don't need to get
[2012.10s -> 2012.86s]  into too much of that,
[2012.86s -> 2014.90s]  but I don't really know
[2014.90s -> 2016.30s]  what that's going to look like.
[2016.38s -> 2016.90s]  Yeah.
[2018.46s -> 2019.50s]  But like I said,
[2019.50s -> 2021.42s]  Brice and his like sort of vision
[2021.42s -> 2022.42s]  and just like the way
[2022.42s -> 2023.46s]  that he builds things
[2023.46s -> 2024.98s]  like you alluded to, it's like.
[2026.10s -> 2028.18s]  Yeah, that creating that
[2028.18s -> 2029.02s]  and that's not like
[2029.02s -> 2029.98s]  creating that culture
[2029.98s -> 2031.54s]  and that's like sort of that whole
[2031.54s -> 2033.26s]  like, you know,
[2033.26s -> 2034.18s]  I'm not the biggest fan
[2034.18s -> 2035.86s]  of like the running cult member
[2035.86s -> 2037.14s]  like slogan or whatever.
[2037.14s -> 2037.58s]  Sure.
[2037.58s -> 2038.62s]  But when he says that,
[2038.62s -> 2039.46s]  when he's making that,
[2039.46s -> 2040.82s]  like he's using the word cult
[2040.82s -> 2042.06s]  as like culture.
[2042.06s -> 2042.70s]  Yes.
[2042.70s -> 2044.14s]  Like like that's the same word
[2044.14s -> 2045.66s]  to him, essentially.
[2045.66s -> 2047.50s]  Yes, it was like, you know, he's
[2047.50s -> 2049.26s]  he's you know, we've all
[2049.26s -> 2050.94s]  like grown up in like skateboarding
[2050.94s -> 2051.94s]  and music.
[2051.94s -> 2053.38s]  And now like we're we like
[2053.38s -> 2054.62s]  landed in the same spot
[2054.62s -> 2055.94s]  with trail running or whatever.
[2055.94s -> 2057.94s]  And it's like all of those activities
[2057.94s -> 2059.22s]  have these sort of like cultures
[2059.22s -> 2060.74s]  that are that are
[2060.74s -> 2062.22s]  like knitted into them.
[2062.22s -> 2062.62s]  Yeah.
[2064.26s -> 2065.98s]  And so like creating these events
[2065.98s -> 2067.42s]  that sort of like
[2067.42s -> 2068.70s]  beyond the trail running,
[2068.70s -> 2070.34s]  but are also like exploring
[2070.34s -> 2071.34s]  the culture of that
[2071.34s -> 2073.02s]  and like whether that be like music
[2073.02s -> 2075.58s]  and bands or like whatever.
[2076.46s -> 2078.74s]  Travel and exploration,
[2078.74s -> 2079.50s]  all those things.
[2079.50s -> 2081.66s]  So it's like
[2081.66s -> 2083.02s]  and like Jamil doesn't really have
[2083.02s -> 2083.86s]  the time to do that
[2083.86s -> 2084.94s]  with his races.
[2084.94s -> 2086.38s]  Yeah, I mean, I think that's why
[2086.38s -> 2087.86s]  he was excited about saddles
[2087.86s -> 2088.94s]  because it was like
[2088.94s -> 2090.90s]  it takes a person like me to like.
[2092.18s -> 2093.38s]  Sort of like see that
[2093.38s -> 2094.54s]  and like create that,
[2094.54s -> 2095.86s]  whereas like that's not exactly
[2095.86s -> 2097.30s]  what they're doing at AeroVipa.
[2097.30s -> 2098.82s]  Like that's a little bit
[2098.82s -> 2099.86s]  different of an approach.
[2099.86s -> 2102.30s]  So you're you're understated.
[2102.30s -> 2103.58s]  And I mean, this as a compliment,
[2103.58s -> 2105.10s]  you're understated,
[2105.10s -> 2106.14s]  but you have like this
[2106.14s -> 2107.38s]  certain touch to things
[2107.38s -> 2108.54s]  that's so consistent
[2108.54s -> 2109.70s]  from one thing to the next.
[2109.70s -> 2111.90s]  And we could call that authenticity,
[2111.90s -> 2114.26s]  but it's also just like.
[2114.26s -> 2117.74s]  A brilliant consistency
[2117.74s -> 2119.98s]  that I could see from
[2119.98s -> 2122.02s]  AeroVipa standpoint,
[2122.02s -> 2122.70s]  they're doing all this
[2122.70s -> 2123.38s]  commercial stuff,
[2123.38s -> 2124.66s]  the world trail majors,
[2124.66s -> 2126.38s]  they're tied in with
[2126.38s -> 2128.22s]  Western states qualifications
[2128.22s -> 2130.14s]  and all this sort of stuff.
[2130.14s -> 2130.94s]  What you're doing
[2130.94s -> 2131.98s]  feels like just because
[2131.98s -> 2132.78s]  of who you are
[2132.78s -> 2133.82s]  and if this is your race
[2133.82s -> 2134.86s]  and you make the final call
[2134.86s -> 2136.42s]  and everything, it's going to remain.
[2136.42s -> 2137.74s]  Maybe maybe it has a thousand people
[2137.74s -> 2139.02s]  at the starting line at some point.
[2139.02s -> 2140.38s]  Yeah, but it's going to remain
[2140.38s -> 2142.14s]  something that's like
[2142.14s -> 2144.06s]  like legit dirt bags,
[2144.06s -> 2144.70s]  not the right word,
[2144.70s -> 2146.58s]  but like ground floor.
[2146.58s -> 2147.38s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[2147.38s -> 2148.78s]  But it's like it's
[2148.78s -> 2149.58s]  like coming from that.
[2149.58s -> 2150.78s]  I think it's hard for people
[2150.78s -> 2152.54s]  like when people talk to me
[2152.54s -> 2155.30s]  about saddles and like
[2155.30s -> 2156.10s]  the amount of like
[2156.10s -> 2157.98s]  unsolicited advice
[2157.98s -> 2160.46s]  I get from people battles.
[2160.46s -> 2162.38s]  And it's like.
[2162.38s -> 2164.06s]  It's really hard for people
[2164.06s -> 2165.58s]  to understand the motives
[2165.58s -> 2167.70s]  of somebody that is
[2167.70s -> 2170.02s]  this is going to sound like
[2170.02s -> 2173.18s]  like supremacist of me.
[2173.18s -> 2174.50s]  It's like it's really hard
[2174.50s -> 2175.30s]  to like understand
[2175.30s -> 2175.98s]  the motives of somebody
[2175.98s -> 2177.62s]  like I do not give a shit
[2177.62s -> 2178.94s]  about like making money
[2178.94s -> 2180.14s]  off of saddles.
[2180.14s -> 2182.62s]  Like it's just like.
[2182.62s -> 2183.54s]  If it happens,
[2183.54s -> 2184.90s]  like, OK, sure, great.
[2184.90s -> 2186.02s]  But it's like I'm not
[2186.02s -> 2187.18s]  at all motivated by
[2187.18s -> 2188.46s]  like trying to do things
[2188.46s -> 2190.74s]  that like increase numbers
[2190.74s -> 2192.62s]  for the sake of increasing numbers.
[2192.62s -> 2193.86s]  Yeah, it's like
[2194.54s -> 2197.74s]  saddles is not this like cancerous
[2197.74s -> 2199.78s]  capitalistic like machine
[2199.78s -> 2200.90s]  where it's like
[2200.90s -> 2201.82s]  get as many runners
[2201.82s -> 2203.14s]  as you can possibly run
[2203.14s -> 2204.34s]  for the sake of it.
[2204.34s -> 2206.58s]  Yeah, it's like if
[2206.58s -> 2208.94s]  if 30 people sign up,
[2208.94s -> 2209.94s]  then I'll throw a race
[2209.94s -> 2210.82s]  for 30 people.
[2210.82s -> 2211.46s]  You know what I mean?
[2211.46s -> 2212.98s]  If one day a thousand people
[2212.98s -> 2213.78s]  are there, like,
[2213.78s -> 2214.86s]  I mean, that would kind of suck.
[2214.86s -> 2216.78s]  But it's like that will be
[2216.78s -> 2218.18s]  like a different event.
[2218.18s -> 2219.66s]  You know what I mean?
[2219.66s -> 2221.06s]  It's like so a lot of time
[2221.06s -> 2222.58s]  race directors, I think.
[2222.58s -> 2223.58s]  And I mean, business
[2223.74s -> 2225.66s]  in general, like you invest,
[2225.66s -> 2227.74s]  you invest in certain things
[2227.74s -> 2229.62s]  to try and increase business.
[2229.62s -> 2230.70s]  Yeah.
[2230.70s -> 2231.58s]  And when you're a business
[2231.58s -> 2232.14s]  who doesn't care
[2232.14s -> 2233.62s]  about increasing business,
[2233.62s -> 2235.10s]  it's like you can sort of
[2235.10s -> 2236.14s]  just do whatever you want.
[2236.14s -> 2237.26s]  So it's like a lot of the bells
[2237.26s -> 2239.50s]  and whistles that exist at races
[2240.98s -> 2242.78s]  exist to try and get
[2242.78s -> 2244.50s]  more people to sign up.
[2244.50s -> 2245.74s]  So it's like
[2245.74s -> 2247.22s]  where whereas like
[2247.22s -> 2248.58s]  even if there's a thousand people,
[2248.58s -> 2249.94s]  I think it'll still feel
[2249.94s -> 2251.34s]  like a shitty race.
[2251.34s -> 2252.06s]  Yeah.
[2252.06s -> 2252.82s]  You know what I mean?
[2252.82s -> 2254.18s]  Which is like the goal
[2254.18s -> 2255.50s]  to keep it that way.
[2255.50s -> 2257.22s]  And it's like because I'm not
[2257.22s -> 2258.22s]  like there's never going to be
[2258.22s -> 2260.18s]  like Expos and like all this,
[2260.18s -> 2261.62s]  you know, like and like Hoka
[2261.62s -> 2263.58s]  and they're fucking
[2263.58s -> 2266.02s]  shit everywhere at these races.
[2266.02s -> 2267.26s]  It's like so obnoxious.
[2267.26s -> 2267.82s]  Yeah.
[2267.82s -> 2268.90s]  It's so obnoxious.
[2268.90s -> 2270.50s]  Like, yeah, like.
[2270.50s -> 2271.30s]  Like.
[2272.34s -> 2273.78s]  It's just yeah.
[2273.78s -> 2276.26s]  And like so it's.
[2277.54s -> 2278.90s]  It'll just be what it is.
[2278.90s -> 2279.54s]  And it's like, yeah,
[2279.54s -> 2280.86s]  I don't have to make it
[2280.86s -> 2282.38s]  anything more than that.
[2282.38s -> 2283.42s]  Yeah.
[2283.42s -> 2284.66s]  Yeah, it's brilliant.
[2284.66s -> 2286.62s]  It's like maybe
[2286.62s -> 2289.42s]  maybe it's like a privileged.
[2289.42s -> 2290.66s]  Place to be coming from
[2290.66s -> 2292.66s]  or whatever, but it's like,
[2292.66s -> 2294.66s]  um, yeah,
[2294.66s -> 2297.38s]  it'll just be what it is and
[2297.38s -> 2299.74s]  um, it's actually a relief
[2299.74s -> 2300.78s]  to like not have to worry
[2300.78s -> 2301.66s]  about all that stuff.
[2301.66s -> 2303.18s]  Yeah, I was having
[2303.18s -> 2304.06s]  a conversation with someone
[2304.06s -> 2306.34s]  the other day about
[2306.34s -> 2307.94s]  Wasatch 100
[2307.94s -> 2310.46s]  and the Bear 100 up here
[2310.46s -> 2311.66s]  that, you know, well,
[2311.66s -> 2313.14s]  I mean, Wasatch even being
[2313.14s -> 2313.86s]  the second hundred
[2313.86s -> 2314.74s]  miler in the country
[2314.74s -> 2315.86s]  after Western states,
[2315.86s -> 2318.46s]  I mean, it's so clearly
[2318.46s -> 2319.42s]  two different approaches
[2319.42s -> 2321.38s]  to ultra running
[2321.38s -> 2322.38s]  and at no fault
[2322.38s -> 2323.70s]  to Western states at all.
[2323.70s -> 2325.10s]  Like they they saw something
[2325.10s -> 2325.98s]  they've they've done.
[2325.98s -> 2326.82s]  They've tried to protect
[2326.82s -> 2327.66s]  whatever it was to,
[2327.66s -> 2328.46s]  but it's huge.
[2328.46s -> 2329.54s]  And it's a it's a big thing.
[2329.54s -> 2330.42s]  It's commercialized
[2330.42s -> 2331.10s]  and it generates
[2331.10s -> 2331.70s]  a lot of revenue,
[2331.70s -> 2333.46s]  even if they're nonprofit.
[2333.46s -> 2333.94s]  On the other hand,
[2333.94s -> 2335.98s]  you have Wasatch, which has
[2335.98s -> 2336.90s]  it feel they feel like
[2336.90s -> 2338.50s]  a 1970s version of you.
[2338.50s -> 2339.34s]  What you're saying here
[2339.34s -> 2341.06s]  of like, hey, like
[2341.18s -> 2342.14s]  and talking with those
[2342.14s -> 2343.22s]  race directors, the founders,
[2343.22s -> 2344.18s]  they're, you know,
[2344.18s -> 2345.14s]  they're just about the runner.
[2345.14s -> 2346.38s]  They want to see runners
[2346.38s -> 2348.70s]  get to their goal of 100 miles
[2349.18s -> 2350.18s]  and they blocked out
[2350.18s -> 2350.78s]  all the other stuff.
[2350.78s -> 2351.90s]  You'll never see the Hoka
[2351.90s -> 2353.50s]  neon light tunnels
[2353.50s -> 2356.14s]  and stuff like that at Wasatch.
[2356.30s -> 2356.66s]  And I don't know
[2356.66s -> 2357.26s]  the bear that well,
[2357.26s -> 2358.10s]  but definitely Wasatch.
[2358.10s -> 2359.70s]  And so it feels like
[2359.70s -> 2360.46s]  you're kind of carrying
[2360.46s -> 2361.62s]  that torch in a way,
[2361.62s -> 2363.30s]  but in your way,
[2363.30s -> 2364.62s]  or just like a unique way,
[2364.62s -> 2366.74s]  like like it feels like,
[2366.74s -> 2367.82s]  you know, John was up here
[2367.82s -> 2369.14s]  at Wasatch.
[2369.14s -> 2370.14s]  Yeah, no, I mean,
[2370.14s -> 2371.90s]  I think Wasatch is a great example
[2371.90s -> 2373.38s]  of like how you can exist
[2373.38s -> 2374.90s]  in today's like race world
[2374.90s -> 2376.62s]  and not not get shitty.
[2376.62s -> 2377.98s]  You know, yeah.
[2377.98s -> 2379.42s]  Yeah, one of my favorite things
[2379.42s -> 2381.26s]  that at the beginning
[2381.26s -> 2382.38s]  of the Wasatch 100,
[2382.38s -> 2383.30s]  when he does the
[2383.30s -> 2385.62s]  like the course rundown,
[2385.62s -> 2386.70s]  he's he always says,
[2386.70s -> 2387.46s]  I'm sure that there's
[2387.46s -> 2388.94s]  a lot of really great runners here.
[2388.94s -> 2389.42s]  There's maybe even
[2389.42s -> 2390.42s]  some sponsored runners here,
[2390.42s -> 2391.14s]  and I'm not going to say
[2391.14s -> 2392.18s]  any of your names
[2392.18s -> 2393.34s]  and everybody claps
[2393.34s -> 2394.02s]  and they move on.
[2394.02s -> 2394.86s]  It's great.
[2394.86s -> 2396.46s]  Yeah, yeah.
[2396.46s -> 2398.46s]  Yeah, no, I mean, that's so again,
[2398.46s -> 2400.02s]  to like loop back around
[2400.02s -> 2401.34s]  to an earlier conversation.
[2401.34s -> 2402.66s]  It's like that that's
[2402.66s -> 2404.14s]  American Trail running.
[2404.14s -> 2405.22s]  Yeah.
[2405.22s -> 2406.42s]  You know,
[2406.42s -> 2407.22s]  do you have any?
[2407.22s -> 2408.30s]  Are you going to bring any?
[2408.30s -> 2409.98s]  So Satisfy is going to come in here
[2409.98s -> 2411.10s]  and relationship.
[2411.10s -> 2412.74s]  Are you going there?
[2412.74s -> 2413.62s]  Are you bringing any of what
[2413.62s -> 2415.18s]  you're doing, your vibe
[2415.18s -> 2417.18s]  to them, to France?
[2417.18s -> 2419.94s]  Yeah, they they've talked about
[2419.94s -> 2422.58s]  we we we've talked about
[2422.58s -> 2424.02s]  maybe the saddles brand
[2424.02s -> 2426.06s]  goes beyond just like the one race
[2426.06s -> 2427.10s]  and maybe we have like
[2427.10s -> 2428.26s]  a few different saddles,
[2428.26s -> 2429.98s]  like around in different spots.
[2429.98s -> 2431.50s]  And like we do we do saddles
[2431.50s -> 2432.14s]  in Europe.
[2432.14s -> 2433.34s]  And it's like,
[2433.34s -> 2434.90s]  because I think Europe,
[2434.90s -> 2436.74s]  like for them,
[2436.74s -> 2438.66s]  I do think like them
[2438.66s -> 2441.30s]  coming out and seeing saddles
[2441.30s -> 2443.18s]  like they like they were all
[2443.18s -> 2444.38s]  just like blown away by it.
[2444.38s -> 2445.54s]  Like they like they
[2445.54s -> 2447.06s]  that doesn't exist in Europe.
[2447.06s -> 2447.82s]  You know what I mean?
[2447.82s -> 2449.38s]  Like the like small
[2449.38s -> 2451.54s]  like everything over there is like,
[2451.54s -> 2454.30s]  you know, is the Tour de France.
[2454.30s -> 2455.82s]  It's like every everything.
[2455.82s -> 2457.62s]  It's just like big corporate,
[2457.62s -> 2460.30s]  like big events, big like
[2460.30s -> 2462.02s]  because because like trail running
[2462.02s -> 2464.30s]  and like cycling and all these
[2464.30s -> 2466.34s]  like weird sort of niche sports
[2466.34s -> 2467.62s]  here in the United States,
[2467.62s -> 2469.34s]  like they're real sports in Europe.
[2469.34s -> 2470.62s]  So it's like, right.
[2470.62s -> 2471.42s]  I'm like, you know,
[2471.42s -> 2472.18s]  you know what I mean?
[2472.18s -> 2473.54s]  There's a lot of the whole thing.
[2473.54s -> 2474.02s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[2474.02s -> 2474.90s]  There's a lot of money.
[2474.90s -> 2476.22s]  There's a lot of sponsorship.
[2476.22s -> 2477.70s]  There's a lot of, you know,
[2477.70s -> 2479.94s]  I mean, it's UTMB in a nutshell,
[2479.94s -> 2482.14s]  you know, and it's like
[2483.58s -> 2484.82s]  and I think for them
[2484.82s -> 2486.86s]  to see a race like saddles,
[2486.86s -> 2491.34s]  like was pretty eye opening for them.
[2491.34s -> 2491.74s]  Yeah.
[2491.74s -> 2495.10s]  And so, yeah, like talking about
[2495.10s -> 2496.22s]  doing something like that
[2496.22s -> 2497.10s]  somewhere in Europe,
[2497.10s -> 2497.90s]  you know what I mean?
[2497.90s -> 2499.02s]  And then that'd be amazing.
[2500.82s -> 2501.98s]  But again, like I don't want
[2501.98s -> 2504.54s]  to extend myself too much,
[2504.54s -> 2505.78s]  you know, you know what I mean?
[2505.78s -> 2507.94s]  And it's like I have a hard time
[2507.94s -> 2511.34s]  with like I would have a hard time
[2511.34s -> 2513.62s]  creating this sort of thing
[2513.62s -> 2516.10s]  and then like having somebody else
[2516.10s -> 2519.38s]  sort of, you know what I mean?
[2519.38s -> 2521.46s]  Like, oh yeah, like I'm pretty big
[2521.46s -> 2523.22s]  on the like, you know,
[2523.22s -> 2524.10s]  again, how I was saying,
[2524.10s -> 2524.90s]  like, you know, running is
[2524.90s -> 2526.26s]  like the fourth thing that I do
[2526.26s -> 2526.74s]  or whatever.
[2526.74s -> 2530.74s]  Like I, like I, I think I have
[2530.74s -> 2532.74s]  like a pretty balanced lifestyle
[2532.74s -> 2534.18s]  and I think that word balance
[2534.18s -> 2535.30s]  gets like tossed around
[2535.30s -> 2537.14s]  by like professional athletes a lot.
[2538.18s -> 2538.42s]  Yeah.
[2538.42s -> 2542.26s]  And it's like, like if you're,
[2542.26s -> 2544.10s]  if you're like a professional athlete,
[2544.10s -> 2545.78s]  like performing at the highest level,
[2545.94s -> 2547.78s]  physically, like you're not balanced.
[2547.78s -> 2549.94s]  There's like nothing about balanced
[2549.94s -> 2551.38s]  about that lifestyle.
[2551.38s -> 2552.10s]  Yeah.
[2552.10s -> 2553.78s]  It's like, and I think
[2553.78s -> 2554.98s]  that's like a misconception
[2554.98s -> 2557.22s]  we have of like athletes in general
[2557.22s -> 2558.34s]  in this world, even on like
[2558.34s -> 2559.86s]  the sort of like major scale,
[2559.86s -> 2562.02s]  you know, like like Michael Jordan
[2562.02s -> 2565.06s]  was like probably not like
[2565.06s -> 2568.10s]  a very like nice like humble like person,
[2568.10s -> 2568.98s]  you know, you know what I mean?
[2568.98s -> 2570.82s]  It's like professional athletes
[2570.82s -> 2572.02s]  at the highest level are not
[2572.02s -> 2574.10s]  these like balanced like family men
[2574.10s -> 2575.78s]  who have like everything in like,
[2576.66s -> 2577.30s]  you know what I mean?
[2577.30s -> 2579.22s]  With like, like their mental health
[2579.22s -> 2580.58s]  is probably not great,
[2580.58s -> 2581.38s]  you know what I mean?
[2581.38s -> 2583.14s]  And so it's like the idea
[2583.14s -> 2584.66s]  of just like, and again,
[2584.66s -> 2586.10s]  what I was saying about like saddles
[2586.10s -> 2587.22s]  doesn't need to just like grow
[2587.22s -> 2588.18s]  for the sake of it.
[2588.18s -> 2589.14s]  It's like if there's not,
[2589.14s -> 2590.18s]  if there's something there
[2590.18s -> 2591.38s]  that like presents itself
[2591.38s -> 2592.66s]  or is like that feels really
[2592.66s -> 2593.94s]  organic and good and like
[2593.94s -> 2595.14s]  we should like try and do that
[2595.14s -> 2596.66s]  and that would be really cool.
[2596.66s -> 2596.90s]  Yeah.
[2596.90s -> 2598.10s]  I mean, you said you were thinking
[2598.10s -> 2599.70s]  about moving back to Paris, like
[2599.70s -> 2602.18s]  I built a house in Catalonia, Spain
[2602.18s -> 2602.50s]  a few years ago.
[2602.50s -> 2602.74s]  Really?
[2603.62s -> 2605.30s]  And so like I want to move back
[2605.30s -> 2606.58s]  to either like Southern France
[2606.58s -> 2607.86s]  or Northern Spain.
[2607.86s -> 2608.34s]  Oh man.
[2608.34s -> 2610.42s]  It's like even if it's not like
[2610.42s -> 2611.86s]  for 12 months out of the year,
[2611.86s -> 2613.78s]  like I also just had a daughter,
[2613.78s -> 2615.30s]  like I have an eight month old
[2615.30s -> 2616.82s]  baby downstairs right now
[2616.82s -> 2619.06s]  and it's like I don't really
[2619.06s -> 2620.42s]  want to raise her here.
[2621.38s -> 2623.70s]  Yeah, here meaning Prescott
[2623.70s -> 2624.18s]  or America.
[2624.18s -> 2625.06s]  Prescott, yeah.
[2626.50s -> 2627.54s]  Like I don't want her to go
[2627.54s -> 2628.90s]  to public school in this town.
[2628.90s -> 2630.42s]  This town is like, yeah.
[2630.42s -> 2631.30s]  I get you.
[2631.30s -> 2632.42s]  I'm from Lubbock, Texas,
[2632.42s -> 2633.22s]  which maybe it's like
[2633.22s -> 2634.42s]  the Prescott of Texas.
[2634.42s -> 2635.30s]  I don't know.
[2635.30s -> 2637.38s]  But I've been in Utah for 22 years
[2638.02s -> 2639.30s]  but I love, yeah.
[2639.30s -> 2640.02s]  I want to take my kids
[2640.02s -> 2641.30s]  out of school here and just go,
[2642.02s -> 2643.14s]  you know, I want to absorb
[2643.14s -> 2644.50s]  some other cultures
[2644.50s -> 2646.42s]  and we love France.
[2646.42s -> 2647.38s]  Could definitely do
[2647.38s -> 2648.26s]  Southern France.
[2648.26s -> 2649.70s]  We spent some time in Barcelona.
[2650.50s -> 2651.62s]  Nothing else, just the food.
[2651.62s -> 2652.66s]  I just want to be really close
[2652.66s -> 2653.22s]  to that food.
[2653.78s -> 2654.02s]  Yeah.
[2654.02s -> 2654.50s]  So good.
[2655.14s -> 2655.38s]  Yeah.
[2655.38s -> 2657.14s]  So it's like, I mean, I have,
[2657.14s -> 2658.58s]  I've been lucky enough to like,
[2658.58s -> 2660.26s]  you know, create these relationships
[2660.26s -> 2661.78s]  and have these opportunities
[2661.78s -> 2663.38s]  that it feels, it would feel sort of
[2663.38s -> 2664.66s]  like wasteful to not.
[2664.66s -> 2665.16s]  Yeah.
[2665.86s -> 2666.58s]  And that's funny.
[2666.58s -> 2667.46s]  I just said that out loud.
[2667.46s -> 2668.26s]  That's actually something
[2668.26s -> 2669.54s]  I said about saddles too.
[2669.54s -> 2671.06s]  Like last year when I was creating
[2671.06s -> 2672.42s]  saddles, it was like,
[2672.42s -> 2673.78s]  I have all these connections.
[2673.78s -> 2675.06s]  I have like made all these like
[2675.06s -> 2677.30s]  friends, whether it be Jamil or like,
[2677.30s -> 2678.66s]  like both vacation races
[2678.66s -> 2680.42s]  in Aerovipa like super,
[2680.42s -> 2682.58s]  like we're like super shadow
[2682.58s -> 2684.58s]  support of saddles last year.
[2684.58s -> 2685.22s]  Oh, nice.
[2685.22s -> 2686.58s]  I drove up to St. George
[2686.58s -> 2688.10s]  and like stole all of their age.
[2688.10s -> 2689.22s]  Oh, from the warehouse?
[2689.22s -> 2689.72s]  Yeah.
[2689.94s -> 2690.98s]  Oh, that's awesome.
[2690.98s -> 2691.86s]  Brought it down here.
[2691.86s -> 2694.34s]  And it's like, and I did the same thing
[2694.34s -> 2694.82s]  with Jamil.
[2694.82s -> 2695.86s]  I like drove down to Phoenix
[2695.86s -> 2696.90s]  and everything I didn't borrow
[2696.90s -> 2698.58s]  from Lyle and Salem,
[2698.58s -> 2699.54s]  I borrowed from Jamil.
[2699.54s -> 2701.54s]  And it was like, so it's like I,
[2701.54s -> 2703.86s]  and then having the support of like
[2703.86s -> 2705.94s]  these like other race companies
[2705.94s -> 2707.38s]  and then the support of,
[2707.38s -> 2708.98s]  of Satisfye and just like,
[2708.98s -> 2710.90s]  you know, like it felt,
[2710.90s -> 2713.38s]  if it felt like silly for me
[2713.38s -> 2714.90s]  to like not take advantage of that
[2714.90s -> 2716.10s]  and like try and put these
[2716.10s -> 2717.38s]  cool events on or whatever.
[2717.38s -> 2718.90s]  Well, I think it's because,
[2718.90s -> 2720.18s]  I mean, there's a million reasons
[2720.18s -> 2721.38s]  that I'm unaware of
[2721.38s -> 2723.30s]  because of your obvious relationships,
[2723.30s -> 2725.94s]  but from a professional standpoint,
[2725.94s -> 2727.30s]  it's because it's refreshing
[2727.30s -> 2728.18s]  to be a part of it.
[2729.54s -> 2730.90s]  Even your wording, you know,
[2730.90s -> 2733.06s]  is so brilliantly, you know, done
[2733.06s -> 2733.38s]  when you're like,
[2733.38s -> 2734.10s]  we're not going to be a
[2734.82s -> 2735.70s]  qualifier for this.
[2735.70s -> 2736.98s]  We're not going to be a,
[2736.98s -> 2738.10s]  when you're on the trail.
[2738.66s -> 2740.50s]  I'm good at talking shit.
[2740.50s -> 2741.94s]  Yeah, but, but you do it
[2741.94s -> 2743.86s]  like with very few words
[2743.86s -> 2745.70s]  and like, so it's like, it just hits.
[2746.26s -> 2747.94s]  And so from a branding standpoint,
[2747.94s -> 2749.70s]  which I, which I'll, you know,
[2749.70s -> 2750.82s]  trust that that's maybe not
[2750.82s -> 2751.78s]  your entire goal.
[2751.78s -> 2752.82s]  It's just back to that thing,
[2752.82s -> 2755.14s]  like, and maybe it's back
[2755.14s -> 2755.46s]  to the thing.
[2755.46s -> 2756.34s]  It's the authenticity.
[2756.90s -> 2758.18s]  Everything expresses itself
[2758.18s -> 2759.46s]  so consistently from one thing
[2759.46s -> 2761.22s]  to another from, you know,
[2761.22s -> 2762.18s]  telling Bruce that you're going
[2762.18s -> 2764.10s]  to do LSD or whatever
[2764.10s -> 2766.02s]  you said over here to,
[2766.02s -> 2766.58s]  I don't care.
[2767.30s -> 2768.50s]  Don't run saddles so that
[2768.50s -> 2769.38s]  you can hopefully someday
[2769.38s -> 2770.18s]  run Western stage,
[2770.18s -> 2771.78s]  run saddles to run saddles.
[2771.78s -> 2772.66s]  Like all of that to me
[2772.66s -> 2774.82s]  is just so like well woven together
[2774.82s -> 2776.42s]  of this like entire
[2776.42s -> 2777.54s]  authentic experience.
[2777.54s -> 2778.82s]  Yeah, I mean, it's not,
[2778.82s -> 2780.34s]  I don't feel like I'm like,
[2780.34s -> 2782.58s]  I have some like into like these,
[2782.58s -> 2784.50s]  like these like takes on things.
[2784.50s -> 2785.62s]  It's like pretty obvious.
[2785.62s -> 2786.90s]  Like we all go to these races
[2786.90s -> 2788.26s]  and like we see the same things
[2788.26s -> 2789.94s]  and it's like, oh, that's weird.
[2789.94s -> 2791.54s]  Yeah, you know what I mean?
[2791.54s -> 2793.86s]  Like, I mean, I was just spent
[2793.86s -> 2795.46s]  two days at Black Canyon City
[2795.46s -> 2799.70s]  and it's like, like is anybody here?
[2799.70s -> 2802.18s]  Is anyone here to just run Black Canyon?
[2802.18s -> 2803.62s]  Or is this like all about
[2803.62s -> 2804.66s]  trying to get in Western?
[2804.66s -> 2806.34s]  Oh, I want to make fun of the golden,
[2807.22s -> 2808.90s]  like the actual golden ticket itself
[2808.90s -> 2810.02s]  is the dumbest thing.
[2810.02s -> 2811.70s]  I can't stand the big ticket.
[2812.34s -> 2814.02s]  Yeah, so then you're standing
[2814.02s -> 2816.26s]  at Black Canyon's on the podium
[2817.06s -> 2818.50s]  promoting Western states.
[2818.50s -> 2819.46s]  Like that's, you know,
[2819.46s -> 2821.22s]  it's four fifths of the picture
[2821.22s -> 2822.42s]  is this is the ticket
[2822.42s -> 2824.10s]  and it's a Black Canyon's race.
[2824.10s -> 2825.78s]  And again, I mean, I get again,
[2825.78s -> 2827.62s]  like I get from a business standpoint
[2827.62s -> 2829.38s]  why like Aerovipa did that
[2829.38s -> 2829.86s]  or whatever.
[2829.86s -> 2830.74s]  And it's sure.
[2830.74s -> 2831.54s]  I mean, like I said,
[2831.54s -> 2833.38s]  like the first year there were 30 of us
[2833.38s -> 2834.74s]  and now they're like the biggest,
[2834.74s -> 2837.14s]  fastest hundred K in the world.
[2837.14s -> 2837.94s]  It's like, or not.
[2837.94s -> 2838.42s]  Yeah.
[2838.42s -> 2838.98s]  You know what I mean?
[2838.98s -> 2839.78s]  It's like, yep.
[2840.42s -> 2842.66s]  But still it's just like Black Canyon
[2842.66s -> 2844.26s]  is so much cooler of a race
[2844.26s -> 2845.22s]  than Western states.
[2845.22s -> 2846.82s]  It's like, it's like,
[2847.46s -> 2849.06s]  why doesn't anyone just
[2849.06s -> 2849.94s]  and I actually feel like
[2849.94s -> 2851.22s]  it was actually fun to partake
[2851.22s -> 2852.10s]  in the 60 K
[2853.14s -> 2854.10s]  because every single one
[2854.10s -> 2855.70s]  of those runners was just running that
[2855.70s -> 2856.98s]  because there's no record for this.
[2856.98s -> 2857.94s]  There's no upside.
[2857.94s -> 2858.98s]  Yeah, it's like it's.
[2858.98s -> 2860.82s]  And so it's like, I love that.
[2862.26s -> 2864.18s]  Yeah, I mean, you know,
[2864.18s -> 2865.70s]  that stuff has to exist,
[2865.70s -> 2868.18s]  but I mean, it also doesn't really.
[2868.18s -> 2871.38s]  Did you ever run Red Hot in Moab?
[2873.14s -> 2875.78s]  No, I think I was chatting
[2875.78s -> 2877.70s]  with those race directors recently
[2877.70s -> 2879.70s]  because Red Hot used to be the race.
[2879.70s -> 2882.26s]  Like it was the it's a it's a February race
[2883.14s -> 2884.50s]  and it had everybody like
[2884.50s -> 2887.38s]  dating back to like Anton Kuprychka
[2887.38s -> 2888.42s]  before there was a lot of money in it.
[2888.42s -> 2889.38s]  There's just great runners.
[2889.38s -> 2890.50s]  Like, you know, every
[2891.30s -> 2892.50s]  that course record has been held
[2892.50s -> 2893.70s]  by every notable male
[2893.70s -> 2895.62s]  of the last like 15 years
[2895.62s -> 2897.06s]  and then Black Canyons came up
[2897.06s -> 2899.06s]  and, you know, maybe this is a testimony
[2899.06s -> 2900.58s]  to Jamil's brilliance as a marketer.
[2901.46s -> 2903.94s]  It it owns the beginning of the year now.
[2903.94s -> 2905.94s]  I mean, all things are Black Canyon
[2905.94s -> 2907.70s]  or, you know, or something are Viper
[2907.70s -> 2909.94s]  because I guess, you know, racing Arizona
[2909.94s -> 2913.22s]  January, February is a pleasant experience.
[2915.06s -> 2915.94s]  Yeah, I don't know how.
[2915.94s -> 2916.98s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[2916.98s -> 2917.62s]  That's crazy.
[2919.30s -> 2920.42s]  I mean, but again, it's that
[2920.42s -> 2921.54s]  it's that sort of like
[2922.66s -> 2924.42s]  cancerous growth of these events.
[2924.42s -> 2925.70s]  Like, why can't Western states
[2925.70s -> 2926.98s]  just be content with having
[2926.98s -> 2928.42s]  the biggest hunter miler
[2928.42s -> 2929.62s]  like in the fucking world?
[2930.82s -> 2932.26s]  Like, why do you have to say like
[2932.90s -> 2936.42s]  like like why do you have to like
[2936.42s -> 2938.58s]  extend your tentacles into like
[2939.22s -> 2939.94s]  all these different
[2940.58s -> 2941.62s]  everybody else's race?
[2941.62s -> 2942.26s]  You know what I mean?
[2942.26s -> 2943.46s]  Or it's like UTMB.
[2943.46s -> 2944.50s]  It's like all this shit
[2944.50s -> 2946.42s]  that UTMB is getting, which by the way
[2946.42s -> 2948.50s]  like everyone will forget about in a few months.
[2948.50s -> 2948.98s]  Absolutely.
[2948.98s -> 2949.62s]  But it's like
[2952.58s -> 2953.86s]  why can't you just be content
[2953.86s -> 2955.94s]  with having the biggest race in the world?
[2955.94s -> 2956.18s]  Yeah.
[2956.74s -> 2958.58s]  Like, why do you have to destroy markets
[2958.58s -> 2959.46s]  other places?
[2959.46s -> 2961.62s]  It's like like because that's like
[2962.18s -> 2963.78s]  and again, I don't want to sound like this.
[2963.78s -> 2965.86s]  I don't want to get to
[2965.86s -> 2967.06s]  I don't want to sound like the
[2967.06s -> 2968.90s]  like anti-capitalist guy.
[2968.90s -> 2969.38s]  You know what I mean?
[2969.38s -> 2970.90s]  I'm not trying to do that.
[2970.90s -> 2972.42s]  But it is like sort of just that.
[2972.42s -> 2973.30s]  Like, why do you have to
[2974.26s -> 2975.78s]  grow for the sake of growth?
[2975.78s -> 2976.74s]  Why can't you like
[2977.94s -> 2979.14s]  put a cap on growth
[2979.14s -> 2980.34s]  and say we're going to make the events
[2980.34s -> 2981.22s]  we do have better
[2981.22s -> 2983.14s]  and more unique for the runners and cooler
[2983.14s -> 2984.82s]  and like and more supportive of the runner.
[2984.82s -> 2985.54s]  I mean, that was a big thing.
[2985.54s -> 2987.62s]  Like I ran Kodiak this year for some reason
[2987.62s -> 2989.06s]  just because I like
[2989.62s -> 2991.06s]  I like always wanted to run that race
[2991.06s -> 2992.42s]  and I didn't really think about it.
[2992.42s -> 2992.98s]  And I was like
[2994.26s -> 2996.90s]  and then I and then I signed up
[2996.90s -> 2997.94s]  and I went out and run
[2997.94s -> 2999.54s]  and it's like the events aren't better
[3000.26s -> 3002.02s]  now that UTMB is involved.
[3002.02s -> 3004.50s]  Yeah, like interesting.
[3004.50s -> 3005.86s]  Like the aid station at Kodiak
[3005.86s -> 3007.14s]  the aid stations at Kodiak
[3007.14s -> 3009.38s]  were like on par with the aid stations at Saddles.
[3011.70s -> 3013.38s]  And it's like I have 100 runners
[3013.38s -> 3014.42s]  and I'm like a weird like
[3014.42s -> 3015.54s]  how are my aid stations
[3015.54s -> 3016.90s]  better than your guys's?
[3016.90s -> 3018.02s]  The only difference
[3018.74s -> 3020.42s]  is the amount of bright blue
[3020.42s -> 3023.86s]  hoax bullshit all over the fucking course.
[3023.86s -> 3024.42s]  Right.
[3024.42s -> 3027.46s]  It's like that's how you're like coming in
[3027.46s -> 3029.22s]  and like so you're just extracting
[3029.22s -> 3031.62s]  like six figures out of all of these communities
[3031.62s -> 3032.98s]  and all of these like races.
[3033.54s -> 3034.82s]  You're not helping runners.
[3034.82s -> 3036.10s]  You're not supporting runners.
[3036.10s -> 3038.42s]  You're not like none of your involvement
[3038.42s -> 3040.50s]  is to make a better runner experience.
[3041.30s -> 3043.78s]  It's just about it's it's you've identified
[3043.78s -> 3045.54s]  a market that you can extract from.
[3045.54s -> 3047.22s]  And the stone system and there's
[3047.22s -> 3049.46s]  and trail running is a big enough sport now.
[3049.46s -> 3051.22s]  Whereas five ten years ago it wasn't.
[3051.22s -> 3052.50s]  It's a big enough sport now
[3052.50s -> 3053.86s]  that Ironman can look at that
[3053.86s -> 3056.26s]  and be like oh there's an extraction opportunity.
[3056.26s -> 3057.54s]  Let's exploit it.
[3057.54s -> 3059.14s]  Yeah, great like good on you.
[3059.14s -> 3061.06s]  Yeah, but like you know
[3062.42s -> 3063.86s]  get out of my fucking sport.
[3065.78s -> 3069.30s]  You know I the the only upside
[3069.30s -> 3071.94s]  that I've ever as I've looked for it is been
[3071.94s -> 3073.54s]  I like Karl Meltzler a lot.
[3074.58s -> 3077.06s]  He represents a certain ethos
[3077.06s -> 3078.50s]  that we've talked about a little bit here
[3079.22s -> 3082.58s]  and he got he got paid you know for
[3082.58s -> 3084.26s]  I don't know what he got paid
[3084.26s -> 3085.62s]  but now you know Speed Goat
[3086.34s -> 3087.94s]  the shortest 100-miler in the country
[3087.94s -> 3089.46s]  it's a you know a brutal 50k
[3090.26s -> 3091.30s]  it now says UTMB.
[3091.30s -> 3093.54s]  I haven't I haven't run it since it's been UTMB.
[3094.26s -> 3095.86s]  Only upside I would say is it's nice
[3095.86s -> 3097.30s]  when someone you know you know
[3097.30s -> 3098.98s]  or at least in your running community
[3098.98s -> 3099.86s]  gets a payday.
[3099.86s -> 3101.62s]  That's I mean I don't I don't know Karl well
[3101.62s -> 3102.98s]  I've met him a few times.
[3102.98s -> 3106.18s]  Like I he strikes me as a guy that I think
[3107.54s -> 3111.06s]  he and I have some similar similarities.
[3111.06s -> 3114.90s]  Yeah but he also has always struck me as like
[3114.90s -> 3118.18s]  you know the Red Bull guy
[3119.86s -> 3122.42s]  and it's like yeah it doesn't surprise me
[3122.42s -> 3124.98s]  that he took a paycheck from UTMB.
[3124.98s -> 3126.66s]  That is interesting that yeah Red Bull
[3127.22s -> 3128.10s]  Red Bull and Trow Ring
[3128.10s -> 3130.82s]  I don't know what they have in common
[3131.46s -> 3132.98s]  but I guess they throw some money
[3132.98s -> 3134.18s]  into Trow Runners sometimes.
[3134.18s -> 3134.66s]  Dylan Bowen.
[3134.66s -> 3136.02s]  Well they were for a while.
[3136.66s -> 3138.50s]  I remember hearing a story
[3138.50s -> 3139.70s]  this is sort of gossip
[3139.70s -> 3141.46s]  about somebody I don't know very well
[3141.46s -> 3142.74s]  so let's talk about it.
[3145.14s -> 3147.30s]  Somebody told me that Dakota Jones
[3147.30s -> 3150.58s]  like turned down a Red Bull contract.
[3150.58s -> 3150.82s]  Really?
[3151.46s -> 3154.02s]  And it was before I had ever met Dakota
[3154.02s -> 3156.26s]  and but it made me like really like him.
[3156.26s -> 3159.22s]  Yeah it was like oh that's cool.
[3159.22s -> 3160.90s]  I know that he lives in Salt Lake now.
[3160.90s -> 3162.26s]  I've never crossed paths with him
[3162.26s -> 3165.62s]  but I do like that he's here otherwise
[3165.62s -> 3167.14s]  and a fantastic runner.
[3167.14s -> 3169.06s]  I did go to UTMB last year
[3169.06s -> 3170.90s]  and he got I think I saw him get third
[3170.90s -> 3173.78s]  at the 100k but yeah.
[3175.38s -> 3176.98s]  But yeah so we'll see I don't know
[3176.98s -> 3178.50s]  you know I mean clearly Saddles
[3178.50s -> 3180.66s]  is never going to be that but you know
[3180.66s -> 3182.98s]  it's like whatever it'll be something
[3182.98s -> 3184.90s]  and it'll exist and you know
[3185.70s -> 3187.14s]  maybe I'll just get buried in debt
[3187.14s -> 3188.58s]  and it'll go away but you know
[3188.58s -> 3189.30s]  I don't think so.
[3189.30s -> 3191.86s]  It's like yeah I mean again
[3191.86s -> 3193.06s]  it's like it's hard to get buried
[3193.06s -> 3194.26s]  in debt when you're not putting
[3194.26s -> 3196.42s]  any money into trying to build.
[3196.42s -> 3198.50s]  Exactly or what I like about
[3198.50s -> 3200.26s]  what I like about race directing
[3200.26s -> 3201.22s]  on that level is that
[3201.22s -> 3202.82s]  like people start to register
[3202.82s -> 3203.62s]  and you get the money
[3203.62s -> 3204.66s]  and you can you build
[3204.66s -> 3206.10s]  according to the money that you have.
[3206.10s -> 3207.46s]  You build accordingly.
[3207.46s -> 3209.06s]  Yeah you don't you're not.
[3209.06s -> 3211.22s]  Yeah so if you've got hospitality
[3211.22s -> 3212.42s]  in mind you can build something
[3212.42s -> 3214.34s]  amazing for 100 runners
[3214.34s -> 3215.78s]  just like you're saying Kodiak
[3215.78s -> 3217.22s]  that you can do better than Kodiak
[3217.94s -> 3220.10s]  for 100 runners if you're just thoughtful.
[3220.10s -> 3221.46s]  In fact maybe you could even do better
[3221.46s -> 3222.66s]  with just 100 runners because
[3222.66s -> 3224.10s]  you've got a little bit less to manage.
[3224.82s -> 3227.22s]  Yeah and I also I think I just like
[3227.22s -> 3229.46s]  I think I'm just kind of good at that stuff.
[3229.46s -> 3232.02s]  Like yeah I'm just like figuring it
[3232.02s -> 3233.54s]  like I think I'm just like
[3233.54s -> 3234.50s]  at the end of the day
[3234.50s -> 3236.34s]  like I'm just good at being cheap.
[3236.34s -> 3238.58s]  It's like I know how to do things
[3238.58s -> 3240.02s]  for not very much money.
[3240.02s -> 3241.22s]  Yeah because I've been like
[3241.22s -> 3242.74s]  essentially poor my whole life
[3243.46s -> 3247.06s]  not I mean you know pouring away
[3247.06s -> 3251.54s]  and it's like so I do think
[3251.54s -> 3253.78s]  like I watch I watch the amount of money
[3253.78s -> 3256.02s]  leaving vacation races at every race
[3256.02s -> 3258.74s]  on this like superfluous insane shit
[3258.74s -> 3260.58s]  and it's just like you guys
[3260.58s -> 3261.86s]  I could do this race for like
[3263.78s -> 3266.10s]  a fifth of what you guys spend money on
[3266.10s -> 3267.62s]  like the shit you guys spend money on
[3267.62s -> 3268.98s]  is insane and it's like
[3269.70s -> 3273.22s]  um but it's like so yeah
[3273.22s -> 3274.26s]  I think I'm just good at like
[3274.26s -> 3276.18s]  kind of figuring out how to still make
[3276.18s -> 3278.42s]  how to make none of the like cheapness
[3278.42s -> 3280.90s]  feel like it's coming at the expense of
[3280.90s -> 3283.22s]  runners and that race a lot of this
[3283.22s -> 3284.90s]  too I mean I feel like I was
[3284.90s -> 3286.34s]  like you know the first time I was
[3286.34s -> 3287.94s]  like really introduced to like race
[3287.94s -> 3289.94s]  directing and being around races
[3289.94s -> 3291.22s]  I just actually did an interview
[3291.22s -> 3294.02s]  with Steve for Cocodona this year
[3294.02s -> 3296.18s]  okay and like we were talking about
[3296.98s -> 3300.10s]  like you know we were talking about
[3300.82s -> 3302.90s]  like Matt's vision for races
[3302.90s -> 3304.42s]  and it's like it was the same thing
[3304.42s -> 3307.54s]  and it's like but Matt was trying to
[3307.54s -> 3309.54s]  do these races and put in some of the
[3309.54s -> 3312.42s]  like hardest logistically spots to like
[3312.42s -> 3314.58s]  put on races and it's like he
[3314.58s -> 3316.18s]  eventually got in over his head or
[3316.18s -> 3321.06s]  whatever but it's like um yeah and
[3321.06s -> 3322.58s]  then just being the type of person I
[3322.58s -> 3323.62s]  am and it's like
[3324.58s -> 3328.34s]  like I do feel like I like have a
[3328.34s -> 3329.78s]  tendency to like come off as being
[3329.78s -> 3331.78s]  like super idealistic and like super
[3331.78s -> 3334.90s]  like critical of things but it's
[3334.90s -> 3337.46s]  like it's sort of what I said earlier
[3337.46s -> 3338.58s]  it's like I don't have these like
[3338.58s -> 3340.42s]  hot takes on anything like it's like
[3340.42s -> 3342.10s]  we all like we all can see these
[3342.10s -> 3343.54s]  things and it's like why are
[3343.54s -> 3346.74s]  things existing this way yeah and
[3346.74s -> 3349.78s]  it's like but then maybe not you
[3349.78s -> 3351.38s]  know like I get shit from people for
[3351.38s -> 3353.86s]  saying that REI shouldn't be in my town
[3353.86s -> 3355.70s]  oh I remember that I was like like I
[3355.70s -> 3357.30s]  get messages from people about like
[3357.30s -> 3359.70s]  how wrong I am about like how REI is
[3359.70s -> 3361.78s]  a co-op and how they're like good for
[3361.78s -> 3364.42s]  local businesses and it's like do I
[3364.42s -> 3365.86s]  really have to fucking explain this
[3365.86s -> 3368.10s]  to you like it's so exhausting it's
[3368.10s -> 3369.78s]  just so exhausting you've bought the
[3369.78s -> 3372.82s]  marketing you've absorbed it it's like
[3372.82s -> 3376.18s]  yeah yeah so it's just like I don't
[3376.18s -> 3378.50s]  know it's but but again I think that
[3378.50s -> 3381.70s]  there are I think the majority of people
[3381.70s -> 3384.34s]  think like I do I think yeah you know
[3384.34s -> 3386.98s]  what I mean it's like it's not
[3386.98s -> 3390.50s]  like the the majority of us don't think
[3390.50s -> 3395.14s]  like a like director of marketing think
[3395.14s -> 3396.74s]  right you know what I mean but the
[3396.74s -> 3398.42s]  directors of marketing are the ones that
[3398.42s -> 3400.18s]  are like controlling and creating
[3400.18s -> 3402.90s]  everything yep even though that's like
[3402.90s -> 3405.06s]  not any of us and it's like so I
[3405.06s -> 3407.30s]  think you can and it's like easy to
[3407.30s -> 3408.90s]  see right it's like you it's like you
[3408.90s -> 3410.90s]  brought up Wasatch or it's like you know
[3410.90s -> 3413.22s]  it's easy to see if it's like locals
[3413.22s -> 3416.82s]  putting on a race or if it's not yes
[3416.82s -> 3418.82s]  yep pretty easy to be like okay like
[3418.82s -> 3421.06s]  well and I don't know why that's so
[3421.06s -> 3422.58s]  hard for people to just say like
[3422.58s -> 3424.90s]  let's just run those races right
[3424.90s -> 3427.22s]  right yeah I think because it's like
[3427.22s -> 3429.46s]  the it's the like bucket list social
[3429.46s -> 3431.54s]  media I feel like that's like why
[3431.54s -> 3433.78s]  western states is like the western
[3433.78s -> 3434.98s]  states isn't even that cool of a
[3434.98s -> 3436.50s]  course like I don't understand why
[3436.50s -> 3439.06s]  it's like I mean I understand why it is
[3439.06s -> 3442.74s]  what it is but but I'm like I've just
[3442.74s -> 3444.50s]  never had a desire to run western
[3444.50s -> 3447.62s]  states yeah it's like like it just you
[3447.62s -> 3449.22s]  just want to run western states
[3449.22s -> 3452.66s]  because it is like the race so you
[3452.66s -> 3454.18s]  want to like tick that box or
[3454.18s -> 3456.98s]  whatever right you know man I don't
[3456.98s -> 3459.06s]  know these other races that are just
[3459.06s -> 3460.66s]  as cool that are just as awesome it's
[3460.66s -> 3462.34s]  like do you know the ultra running
[3462.34s -> 3465.46s]  historian Davey Crockett no oh dude
[3465.46s -> 3466.74s]  you'd get a you'd get a kick out of
[3466.74s -> 3468.34s]  this guy he's I don't know he's
[3468.34s -> 3470.26s]  self-proclaimed he's created his own
[3470.26s -> 3474.42s]  uh trail running uh hall of fame and
[3474.42s -> 3476.58s]  he's run he's probably in his 70s he
[3476.58s -> 3478.10s]  just finishes like hundreds hundred
[3478.10s -> 3483.06s]  miler uh he he dismantles the
[3483.06s -> 3485.70s]  history of uh western states you
[3485.70s -> 3487.70s]  know where that gordy invented the
[3487.70s -> 3489.30s]  hundred mile distance and all this
[3489.30s -> 3492.82s]  sort of stuff he it's he it's a
[3492.82s -> 3494.74s]  little bit of a dry delivery
[3494.74s -> 3496.42s]  but I should send it to you but you'd
[3496.42s -> 3497.46s]  get a kick out of this guy he just
[3497.46s -> 3499.14s]  dismantles all the all of these all
[3499.14s -> 3501.94s]  this lore that surrounds western states
[3501.94s -> 3503.46s]  and it's like it's not true about
[3503.46s -> 3506.98s]  gordy yes no it's like no yeah yeah
[3506.98s -> 3508.90s]  but if you watch uh unbreakable
[3508.90s -> 3510.82s]  which I love that documentary it sets
[3510.82s -> 3513.30s]  it up to say gordy ainsley you know
[3513.30s -> 3515.30s]  was the first person to do this and
[3515.30s -> 3516.82s]  yeah I didn't say like he invented
[3516.82s -> 3518.50s]  trail running or something like
[3518.50s -> 3522.98s]  yeah like what yeah yeah yeah
[3523.86s -> 3526.02s]  well I hope to make it out to to saddle
[3526.02s -> 3528.18s]  sometime I think we're we're going
[3528.18s -> 3529.62s]  we just our family just bought one way
[3529.62s -> 3531.46s]  tickets to France in July
[3531.46s -> 3533.30s]  hoping to hoping to be able to get to
[3533.30s -> 3534.74s]  stay there for a few years at least
[3534.74s -> 3537.06s]  one uh but I want to be at saddles
[3537.06s -> 3538.58s]  but if there's a saddles in France
[3538.58s -> 3541.62s]  I'll definitely be there yeah I don't
[3541.62s -> 3543.30s]  know I it's I mean that's you know
[3543.30s -> 3545.14s]  that's barely in conversation at this
[3545.14s -> 3546.58s]  point I had I don't know what that
[3546.58s -> 3549.94s]  would look like I um like I said we
[3549.94s -> 3551.30s]  just had a baby I I mean the
[3551.30s -> 3552.90s]  hardest thing I feel like
[3552.90s -> 3557.14s]  is not the baby it's like the dogs
[3557.14s -> 3559.46s]  totally I completely agree we didn't do
[3559.46s -> 3561.54s]  much until our dog died after like
[3561.54s -> 3564.18s]  it's like 13 years old yeah I mean
[3564.18s -> 3566.26s]  wasn't until then that we felt like
[3566.26s -> 3567.86s]  we could travel because otherwise
[3567.86s -> 3569.78s]  no one wants your dogs for that long
[3569.78s -> 3571.22s]  yeah well I don't even want to leave
[3571.22s -> 3573.14s]  my dog for that long so it's like I
[3573.14s -> 3575.30s]  I you know I would have to figure
[3575.30s -> 3576.66s]  that out and I guess there are ways
[3576.66s -> 3578.82s]  of figuring that out but yeah but
[3578.90s -> 3581.78s]  sucks too yeah I don't know we'll see
[3581.78s -> 3585.14s]  what happens well cool man well thanks
[3585.14s -> 3586.66s]  for your time I hope we can do this
[3586.66s -> 3588.10s]  again sometime in person if you if
[3588.10s -> 3589.78s]  you do end up doing Zion I'm running
[3589.78s -> 3592.18s]  Zion so maybe we cross paths there if
[3592.18s -> 3594.26s]  you end up uh yeah it's looking like
[3594.26s -> 3596.90s]  I'll probably be at the races again
[3596.90s -> 3599.22s]  this year so okay did the Antelope
[3599.22s -> 3600.74s]  Canyon has that has that happened
[3600.74s -> 3604.18s]  yet no that's a couple weeks so that
[3604.18s -> 3606.18s]  Antelope Canyon is a weird thing
[3606.18s -> 3608.02s]  because the people at Antelope Canyon
[3608.02s -> 3609.62s]  are used to working with Lyle
[3609.62s -> 3612.42s]  yes they only want to work with Lyle
[3612.42s -> 3614.98s]  yeah but it seems like they're
[3614.98s -> 3616.18s]  figuring it out
[3616.18s -> 3618.58s]  and and and last I heard was that
[3618.58s -> 3621.62s]  that race is is still happening
[3621.62s -> 3625.78s]  okay um yeah that's actually a thing
[3625.78s -> 3629.06s]  I don't I don't know that well
[3629.06s -> 3630.50s]  those people might listen to this
[3630.50s -> 3632.58s]  podcast but
[3632.58s -> 3634.18s]  like that's actually been a hard
[3634.18s -> 3635.86s]  thing for me to like stay involved
[3635.86s -> 3636.42s]  with
[3636.42s -> 3638.18s]  yeah just like based off of my own
[3638.18s -> 3640.34s]  reputation and
[3640.34s -> 3643.14s]  um I feel like they differ a lot in
[3643.14s -> 3644.34s]  how
[3644.34s -> 3648.34s]  you know our approaches towards
[3648.34s -> 3651.86s]  right things yep and um
[3651.86s -> 3653.46s]  I've I've been able to sort of like
[3653.46s -> 3655.22s]  compartmentalize that and just say
[3655.22s -> 3656.82s]  like well I'm just here
[3656.82s -> 3659.54s]  again sort of as a third party yeah
[3659.54s -> 3662.98s]  you know what I mean and um
[3662.98s -> 3664.90s]  but I mean I mean ever since Matt
[3664.90s -> 3666.42s]  left it's like
[3666.42s -> 3668.90s]  uh it's been it's been internal
[3668.90s -> 3670.18s]  dialogue for sure
[3670.18s -> 3672.50s]  about why I'm still involved with this
[3672.50s -> 3673.78s]  company you know
[3673.78s -> 3675.30s]  but yeah I don't know that company
[3675.30s -> 3677.30s]  is crazy yeah and all the
[3677.30s -> 3678.34s]  international stuff
[3678.34s -> 3680.58s]  feels like that's more their focus
[3680.58s -> 3683.54s]  I'd want to do I really want to um
[3683.54s -> 3684.58s]  if something ever happened those
[3684.58s -> 3686.26s]  races I'd want to be a part of
[3686.26s -> 3688.66s]  keeping something alive in Zion
[3688.66s -> 3690.34s]  or at least that you know Apple Valley
[3690.34s -> 3691.46s]  and all that I just love that area
[3691.46s -> 3693.46s]  so much
[3693.46s -> 3695.30s]  yeah they actually so they bought those
[3695.30s -> 3697.94s]  like 60 acres up I know
[3697.94s -> 3700.42s]  I know I'd really like to have those
[3700.42s -> 3701.62s]  for myself
[3701.62s -> 3703.86s]  but that's not on the table but
[3703.86s -> 3705.22s]  that's a that's been like another
[3705.22s -> 3707.06s]  opportunity I've had is like
[3707.06s -> 3708.90s]  I just like build tiny houses and put
[3708.90s -> 3711.70s]  them on that property
[3711.70s -> 3714.58s]  you know it's like but you know
[3714.58s -> 3716.58s]  there's lots of opportunities I don't
[3716.58s -> 3718.10s]  like like I said it's so like
[3718.10s -> 3718.82s]  that's like
[3718.82s -> 3720.42s]  another thing like starting out
[3720.42s -> 3724.02s]  saddles is like um I think in a lot of
[3724.02s -> 3726.10s]  ways once my daughter was born like I
[3726.10s -> 3727.30s]  sort of had this
[3727.30s -> 3730.74s]  reaction that's like pretty opposite to
[3730.74s -> 3732.02s]  what like you're supposed to
[3732.02s -> 3733.86s]  have as a reaction in becoming a
[3733.86s -> 3735.30s]  parent
[3735.30s -> 3739.70s]  it's like I got really I feel like
[3739.70s -> 3741.22s]  you know that sort of like cliche
[3741.22s -> 3742.58s]  thing like oh like
[3742.58s -> 3744.98s]  can't do this anymore like blah like
[3744.98s -> 3746.74s]  you know like all that shit and it's
[3746.74s -> 3747.86s]  like
[3747.86s -> 3749.94s]  I like I reacted like pretty violently
[3749.94s -> 3752.34s]  to that to her in the sense of like I
[3752.34s -> 3754.02s]  only want to do things that are like
[3754.02s -> 3755.46s]  interesting now
[3755.46s -> 3757.38s]  like I don't want it like yes you
[3757.38s -> 3759.62s]  know what I mean like my daughter's not
[3759.62s -> 3760.90s]  like my daughter's not going to give
[3760.90s -> 3763.14s]  a shit about like whatever like tiny
[3763.14s -> 3765.14s]  house I built and sold to somebody
[3765.14s -> 3767.46s]  you know what I mean but like as much
[3767.46s -> 3769.38s]  as like I sort of cringe at things
[3769.38s -> 3769.78s]  like
[3769.78s -> 3772.42s]  you know live streams or documentaries
[3772.42s -> 3774.10s]  or like youtube or fucking
[3774.10s -> 3776.18s]  floater cans you know what I mean
[3776.18s -> 3777.46s]  it's like
[3777.46s -> 3779.22s]  it's like that what what I've like
[3779.22s -> 3781.14s]  sort of realizes like that stuff's not
[3781.14s -> 3782.10s]  really about me
[3782.10s -> 3783.78s]  you know what I mean like if like in 10
[3783.78s -> 3785.30s]  years my daughter can like watch
[3785.30s -> 3787.14s]  documentaries of her dad and like hold
[3787.14s -> 3788.18s]  a soda can
[3788.18s -> 3791.06s]  with her dad's picture on that yeah it's
[3791.06s -> 3792.26s]  like where I'm going with that is
[3792.26s -> 3794.18s]  like I I only want to invest my time
[3794.18s -> 3797.30s]  in things that like
[3797.30s -> 3799.62s]  like are going to be like an
[3799.62s -> 3800.66s]  interesting life
[3800.66s -> 3804.98s]  for her yes like I finally like
[3804.98s -> 3806.82s]  because I mean that that is a trope
[3806.82s -> 3808.50s]  about like being a parent that's true
[3808.50s -> 3810.10s]  it's like it's you know
[3810.10s -> 3812.50s]  you stop doing things for yourself you
[3812.50s -> 3813.46s]  know
[3813.46s -> 3816.98s]  and so it's like um and I think that's
[3816.98s -> 3818.34s]  good for everyone I think that's good
[3818.34s -> 3820.02s]  for my whole family I think that's good
[3820.02s -> 3821.70s]  for me and it's like
[3821.70s -> 3826.18s]  so like like even though we were like
[3826.18s -> 3828.10s]  like pregnant and like having a
[3828.10s -> 3830.42s]  newborn last year at Saddles is like
[3830.42s -> 3832.34s]  it was still time to like invest my
[3832.34s -> 3835.30s]  time in things that aren't like
[3835.30s -> 3837.94s]  pulling wire you know and like like
[3837.94s -> 3839.54s]  I don't want to invest my time in dumb
[3839.54s -> 3840.66s]  shit anymore
[3840.66s -> 3842.82s]  yeah yeah I think what's I don't want
[3842.82s -> 3844.50s]  to like I don't want to just sit and
[3844.50s -> 3846.50s]  press kit and raise my
[3846.50s -> 3851.06s]  kid like in
[3851.06s -> 3853.38s]  like I don't want to raise my kid in
[3853.38s -> 3854.74s]  like obnoxious
[3854.74s -> 3857.38s]  Trump USA like I just like don't you
[3857.38s -> 3860.74s]  know what I mean and so it's like
[3860.74s -> 3862.50s]  like the culture in this town is not
[3862.50s -> 3863.38s]  nice
[3863.38s -> 3866.82s]  it's not friendly it's like it's not
[3866.82s -> 3869.38s]  you know it's combative and it's shitty
[3869.38s -> 3870.50s]  and it's like
[3870.50s -> 3872.02s]  I just don't want her to be exposed so
[3872.02s -> 3873.38s]  like I want to move and it's like I
[3873.38s -> 3874.66s]  mean I guess like stuff like that
[3874.66s -> 3876.26s]  exists everywhere but it's like
[3876.26s -> 3879.54s]  sure like I just so like
[3879.54s -> 3882.82s]  I just want all things to be
[3882.82s -> 3884.18s]  worthwhile
[3884.18s -> 3886.10s]  with my time and so like building
[3886.10s -> 3887.22s]  Saddles
[3887.22s -> 3890.42s]  investing in Satisfye like
[3890.42s -> 3894.42s]  investing in cooler things than
[3894.42s -> 3898.74s]  like yeah yeah yeah I think what's true
[3898.74s -> 3899.62s]  is that
[3899.62s -> 3901.54s]  the like you say the trope of like
[3901.54s -> 3903.14s]  your life kind of becomes about
[3903.14s -> 3906.02s]  your kids the one that's not true is
[3906.02s -> 3907.38s]  that
[3907.38s -> 3908.82s]  the the thing that comes in tandem
[3908.82s -> 3910.34s]  with that is becoming is living a
[3910.34s -> 3911.54s]  more predictable
[3911.54s -> 3913.86s]  life like you have to you know the
[3913.86s -> 3915.06s]  quote-unquote settle down my wife
[3915.06s -> 3916.90s]  and we're afraid of that
[3916.90s -> 3918.66s]  we've rebelled and you know I'm 41
[3918.66s -> 3920.10s]  now and it's like
[3920.10s -> 3922.58s]  we're we're taking three kids out of
[3922.58s -> 3923.30s]  school
[3923.30s -> 3925.70s]  trying to go to France and it's like
[3925.70s -> 3927.22s]  it's a lot of work and I'm feeling my
[3927.22s -> 3928.10s]  age right now like
[3928.10s -> 3930.26s]  can I can I can I take can I take a
[3930.26s -> 3931.30s]  10-year-old
[3931.30s -> 3933.38s]  seven-year-old and a four-year-old to
[3933.38s -> 3934.66s]  the heart of Paris
[3934.66s -> 3936.90s]  and for 12 months and it's just it
[3936.90s -> 3937.94s]  feels like
[3937.94s -> 3939.30s]  well if I don't do this now then
[3939.30s -> 3941.06s]  I'm going to go down that other path
[3941.06s -> 3942.50s]  of the trope that I think is not
[3942.50s -> 3944.58s]  true that
[3944.58s -> 3946.10s]  my life is about my kids and I'm
[3946.10s -> 3947.46s]  also making really boring predictable
[3947.46s -> 3948.82s]  day in and day out decisions
[3948.82s -> 3950.90s]  to accommodate that I don't want that
[3950.90s -> 3953.94s]  yeah yeah it's like we said earlier
[3953.94s -> 3954.26s]  like
[3954.26s -> 3957.86s]  it's the dogs are harder than the kids
[3957.86s -> 3959.54s]  yeah yeah because airplanes will allow
[3959.54s -> 3961.30s]  kids yeah
[3961.30s -> 3963.06s]  it's like yeah I and I mean I think
[3963.06s -> 3964.58s]  that's another good example of what
[3964.58s -> 3966.02s]  we were talking about before it was
[3966.02s -> 3967.78s]  like I think we all know this we all
[3967.78s -> 3970.26s]  know these things it's like it's not
[3970.26s -> 3971.86s]  and we we all like know the people
[3971.86s -> 3973.70s]  who do like say those things or
[3973.70s -> 3974.82s]  people who don't live very
[3974.82s -> 3976.50s]  interesting lives themselves
[3976.50s -> 3978.74s]  so it's like yeah um they take
[3978.74s -> 3980.34s]  comfort in the fact that like
[3980.34s -> 3982.18s]  you have a kid now and so they want you
[3982.18s -> 3983.86s]  to be boring as well because it makes
[3983.86s -> 3985.46s]  them feel better
[3985.46s -> 3989.78s]  but it's like you know I mean yes
[3989.78s -> 3992.42s]  yes it is more work yes it requires
[3992.42s -> 3992.98s]  to be
[3992.98s -> 3995.22s]  it requires you to be more thoughtful
[3995.22s -> 3997.22s]  yeah and like in like how you how
[3997.22s -> 3998.66s]  you
[3998.66s -> 4001.62s]  fulfill those things but like
[4001.62s -> 4003.86s]  I can't believe like how excited I am
[4003.86s -> 4006.02s]  to get to like
[4006.02s -> 4008.02s]  show my daughter spain you know what I
[4008.02s -> 4009.86s]  mean and it's like
[4009.86s -> 4012.18s]  like take her I don't know it's just
[4012.18s -> 4013.78s]  it's just a really exciting adventure
[4013.78s -> 4016.34s]  yeah to like be able to
[4016.34s -> 4019.94s]  to and again a lot of things I say
[4019.94s -> 4021.30s]  are like pretty privileged
[4021.30s -> 4025.94s]  and I get that but it's also like
[4025.94s -> 4027.78s]  um there's nothing more exciting to me
[4027.78s -> 4030.42s]  than being able to like
[4030.42s -> 4033.46s]  yeah just give her a really
[4033.46s -> 4034.74s]  interesting fun
[4034.74s -> 4037.86s]  yeah lifestyle you know yeah man and
[4038.66s -> 4040.02s]  I think that comes with age too you
[4040.02s -> 4042.34s]  know I'm 38 and just had my first baby
[4042.34s -> 4045.78s]  yeah yeah my last when I was 38
[4045.78s -> 4048.50s]  37 yeah makes you feel younger
[4048.50s -> 4051.30s]  I mean I I as I'm 41 when my dad was
[4051.30s -> 4053.78s]  41 I was a lot older so it's like
[4053.78s -> 4055.30s]  you know keeps me young keeps me
[4055.30s -> 4057.46s]  feeling young
[4057.46s -> 4058.90s]  yeah and then the trail running too
[4058.90s -> 4060.50s]  is like you know like
[4060.50s -> 4063.06s]  what's saddles was an opportunity to
[4063.06s -> 4064.26s]  like
[4064.26s -> 4065.54s]  still be involved in the trail
[4065.54s -> 4067.38s]  running thing as I get older you know
[4067.38s -> 4069.62s]  I mean even like yesterday like
[4069.62s -> 4071.86s]  I ran for as hard as I fucking could
[4071.86s -> 4074.34s]  for four hours and 45 minutes
[4074.34s -> 4078.42s]  and you know I lost by 40 minutes
[4078.42s -> 4080.50s]  you know what I mean it's like like the
[4080.50s -> 4082.98s]  reality is that like
[4082.98s -> 4084.90s]  it's just a different sport now these
[4084.90s -> 4087.62s]  kids showing up to these races
[4087.62s -> 4090.74s]  like yeah like I can't I can't
[4090.74s -> 4092.66s]  I can't play around with that yeah
[4092.66s -> 4094.42s]  these are all the kids even in my
[4094.42s -> 4096.74s]  like best of best days like that's
[4096.74s -> 4098.90s]  not who I was that's not who I ever was
[4098.90s -> 4100.50s]  and it's like I can't play around with
[4100.50s -> 4101.54s]  real runners
[4101.54s -> 4103.62s]  right and it's also I'm like 38 now
[4103.62s -> 4105.38s]  and it just hurts a lot more
[4105.38s -> 4107.70s]  and it's like it's just like that's
[4107.70s -> 4109.22s]  like coca-dona this year
[4109.22s -> 4111.70s]  I mean it's like I've participated
[4111.70s -> 4113.54s]  every year
[4113.54s -> 4115.46s]  the first year was the only year that
[4115.46s -> 4117.14s]  I thought that I could even do it
[4117.14s -> 4118.74s]  the the last two years have just
[4118.74s -> 4120.58s]  been participation trophies like I
[4120.58s -> 4122.10s]  knew I wasn't going to finish both
[4122.10s -> 4124.10s]  years
[4124.10s -> 4126.10s]  like this year I am going to run but
[4126.10s -> 4128.10s]  whether I win or whether I drop it's
[4128.10s -> 4129.70s]  it's going to be the last year I
[4129.70s -> 4131.70s]  participate in coca-dona
[4131.70s -> 4133.78s]  I am though trying to go into
[4133.78s -> 4135.86s]  coca-dona like at least somewhat
[4135.86s -> 4137.38s]  prepared for it this year
[4137.38s -> 4139.70s]  like which has never which has never
[4139.70s -> 4140.50s]  happened
[4140.50s -> 4142.74s]  yeah um even the first year that I
[4142.74s -> 4144.90s]  ran I wasn't like ready for it it
[4144.90s -> 4146.34s]  was so funny it was just this like
[4146.34s -> 4148.10s]  impulsive thing
[4148.10s -> 4150.66s]  so like now again I've aged a lot in
[4150.66s -> 4153.54s]  the last few years like both like
[4154.18s -> 4156.90s]  intellectually like emotionally and like
[4156.90s -> 4158.18s]  physically so it's like
[4158.18s -> 4162.18s]  yeah um even going into coca-dona
[4162.18s -> 4163.38s]  prepared I don't think that that
[4163.38s -> 4165.30s]  guarantees anything
[4165.30s -> 4166.98s]  but but I would like to at least
[4166.98s -> 4168.42s]  say once in my life
[4168.42s -> 4172.10s]  I ran that race actually like
[4172.10s -> 4173.94s]  kind of trained for it and ready to
[4173.94s -> 4175.78s]  do that versus just like popping in
[4175.78s -> 4177.70s]  the night before
[4177.70s -> 4180.42s]  it's like uh so yeah we'll see you
[4180.42s -> 4181.70s]  know what I mean and and I just
[4181.70s -> 4185.78s]  like I have like these um
[4185.78s -> 4187.30s]  I actually saw that you have you're
[4187.30s -> 4188.82s]  going to interview McKnight like
[4188.82s -> 4193.06s]  tomorrow yeah yeah it's like um
[4193.06s -> 4194.10s]  it's weird I'm going to bring up
[4194.10s -> 4196.58s]  Michael Jordan again for the second
[4196.58s -> 4197.70s]  time in an interview I don't ever
[4197.70s -> 4199.94s]  talk about people like that
[4199.94s -> 4201.70s]  I remember watching like the that
[4201.70s -> 4203.30s]  whatever that documentary came out
[4203.30s -> 4205.38s]  about him and yeah he was saying
[4205.38s -> 4207.30s]  that he like makes up rivalries with
[4207.30s -> 4208.02s]  people
[4208.02s -> 4210.42s]  yes just to like get pissed off at
[4210.42s -> 4212.02s]  them and like yeah I feel like
[4212.02s -> 4213.46s]  there's a part of me that like I've
[4213.46s -> 4215.38s]  like made up this pretend rivalry
[4215.38s -> 4216.82s]  between me and McKnight that like he
[4216.82s -> 4219.22s]  has no idea exists
[4219.22s -> 4223.38s]  yeah yeah like uh yeah so I need to
[4223.38s -> 4225.14s]  I need to go back and just like not
[4225.14s -> 4226.18s]  let him
[4226.18s -> 4228.34s]  have the course record on anything
[4228.34s -> 4231.62s]  yeah yeah I like that I from I
[4231.62s -> 4232.66s]  mean just even from the standpoint
[4232.66s -> 4233.38s]  of like
[4233.38s -> 4235.94s]  you know feeling old the the
[4235.94s -> 4237.54s]  going from the feeling old statement
[4237.54s -> 4238.90s]  like you just write you also like
[4238.90s -> 4240.26s]  naturally go back to the
[4240.26s -> 4241.78s]  there's like a competitor in you that's
[4241.78s -> 4243.94s]  still gonna like if this is your last
[4243.94s -> 4244.98s]  year
[4244.98s -> 4246.18s]  that you're gonna go for it like
[4246.18s -> 4247.30s]  you're gonna you're gonna go for it
[4247.30s -> 4248.34s]  you're gonna you're going for the
[4248.34s -> 4248.74s]  win
[4248.74s -> 4250.02s]  well no I mean I do think that's a
[4250.02s -> 4251.54s]  misunderstanding about me
[4251.54s -> 4255.46s]  of the fact that like
[4255.46s -> 4258.26s]  like when I run a race like I care
[4258.26s -> 4260.50s]  yeah you know what I mean I I mean I
[4260.50s -> 4262.74s]  feel like my whole brand is
[4262.74s -> 4264.34s]  to whatever people think I am and
[4264.34s -> 4266.10s]  whoever people whatever people think I
[4266.10s -> 4267.30s]  am it's like
[4267.30s -> 4268.66s]  is that like I just don't like don't
[4268.66s -> 4270.26s]  care about anything I'm just like out
[4270.26s -> 4271.62s]  there like wandering around on
[4271.62s -> 4274.58s]  mushrooms 24 hours a day and it's like
[4274.58s -> 4278.42s]  um but it's like no like if I run a
[4278.42s -> 4279.78s]  race like I'm
[4279.78s -> 4282.18s]  like I'm trying to win like I'm gonna
[4282.18s -> 4283.38s]  try like I have that
[4283.38s -> 4285.06s]  part of me it's like why else would
[4285.06s -> 4286.74s]  I be there right
[4286.74s -> 4288.34s]  it's like I can go run coca-dona
[4288.34s -> 4289.54s]  any day of the year
[4289.54s -> 4291.14s]  yeah you know what I mean like I'm
[4291.14s -> 4293.14s]  here to race these people
[4293.14s -> 4295.78s]  it's like it's like I have that I mean
[4295.78s -> 4296.34s]  it's
[4296.34s -> 4298.50s]  I don't think I have it as much as other
[4298.50s -> 4300.26s]  people do like clearly
[4300.26s -> 4303.22s]  but I mean but I you know I I want to do
[4303.22s -> 4304.34s]  well I want
[4304.34s -> 4305.70s]  and I feel like that was a big part
[4305.70s -> 4307.54s]  of me dropping coca-dona last year
[4307.54s -> 4309.06s]  was like
[4309.06s -> 4310.98s]  like could I have like laid down for
[4310.98s -> 4312.58s]  12 hours and like slept
[4312.58s -> 4314.10s]  and like kept going and like
[4314.10s -> 4315.94s]  eventually finished like of course I
[4315.94s -> 4317.06s]  could have done that
[4317.06s -> 4320.26s]  yeah but it's hard for competitive
[4320.26s -> 4321.70s]  athletes to stay
[4322.66s -> 4326.58s]  like when you know that you're not
[4326.58s -> 4328.82s]  going to do what you're capable of
[4328.82s -> 4330.74s]  potentially doing at a race
[4330.74s -> 4333.38s]  yes like how do you stay motivated
[4333.38s -> 4334.98s]  because we know we could finish
[4334.98s -> 4336.34s]  it's like yes of course we could
[4336.34s -> 4336.98s]  finish
[4336.98s -> 4339.14s]  yeah like am I willing to like put
[4339.14s -> 4341.78s]  myself through 48 more hours of like
[4341.78s -> 4342.90s]  complete suffering
[4342.90s -> 4344.58s]  and dread just to finish a race
[4344.58s -> 4346.10s]  I've already finished before
[4346.10s -> 4349.38s]  yeah just to finish like
[4349.38s -> 4352.18s]  um like I've sort of lost that
[4352.18s -> 4353.78s]  yeah a little bit in my ultra running
[4353.78s -> 4355.46s]  like I don't have the finish at all
[4355.46s -> 4356.42s]  cost
[4356.42s -> 4358.74s]  mentality anymore that's probably why
[4358.74s -> 4360.10s]  I'm not very good at ultra running
[4360.10s -> 4361.94s]  anymore
[4361.94s -> 4363.86s]  I don't know I just like I don't
[4363.86s -> 4365.46s]  necessarily have that
[4365.46s -> 4368.26s]  part of me anymore but it's like I do
[4368.26s -> 4369.78s]  think this year at coca-dona I
[4369.78s -> 4371.30s]  need to get over that I need to like
[4371.30s -> 4372.90s]  sort of just accept the fact that
[4372.90s -> 4374.18s]  like
[4374.18s -> 4376.82s]  you know it's my last year out there
[4376.82s -> 4378.10s]  regardless of whether or not I'm
[4378.10s -> 4379.70s]  being competitive like just try and
[4379.70s -> 4380.50s]  finish
[4380.50s -> 4383.70s]  yeah yeah I've always admired when
[4383.70s -> 4385.54s]  um I mean it's I should say it's
[4385.54s -> 4386.90s]  made sense to me when someone like
[4386.90s -> 4387.70s]  you
[4387.70s -> 4390.66s]  who is competitive when you are
[4390.66s -> 4392.74s]  clearly not going to win that you
[4392.74s -> 4395.86s]  step out of the race because you know
[4395.86s -> 4396.42s]  if
[4396.42s -> 4397.70s]  let's assume our bodies only have a
[4397.70s -> 4399.22s]  certain number of miles on them
[4399.22s -> 4402.98s]  total why throw why throw 150 miles on
[4402.98s -> 4404.50s]  your body
[4404.50s -> 4406.18s]  on you know on just getting to
[4406.18s -> 4408.02s]  finish when you could
[4408.02s -> 4411.46s]  go back recover and you know
[4411.46s -> 4414.26s]  have more in the tank next year yeah
[4414.26s -> 4416.18s]  and it's also it's not
[4416.18s -> 4419.54s]  like multi-day racing is not like
[4419.54s -> 4422.42s]  it's it's it's it's an experience not
[4422.42s -> 4423.62s]  a lot of people
[4423.62s -> 4426.82s]  know yeah like running 250 miles is
[4426.82s -> 4428.50s]  not running two and a half
[4428.50s -> 4432.18s]  hundred milers it's like or whatever
[4432.18s -> 4434.10s]  whatever sort of like yeah person you
[4434.10s -> 4434.98s]  want to make there
[4435.06s -> 4439.38s]  it's like I've I've
[4439.38s -> 4443.22s]  still I physically um like mentally I
[4443.22s -> 4445.14s]  I don't think that I've recovered from
[4445.14s -> 4448.34s]  my Colorado Trail experience really
[4448.34s -> 4451.70s]  like that like it destroyed me
[4451.70s -> 4456.90s]  like like dad and it's like
[4456.90s -> 4459.54s]  these things are not good for you
[4459.54s -> 4461.38s]  these things are not
[4461.38s -> 4463.78s]  like and and they have real like
[4463.78s -> 4467.62s]  repercussions it's like
[4467.62s -> 4469.38s]  it's not like a hundred miler where
[4469.38s -> 4472.66s]  like you think a repercussion is like
[4472.66s -> 4474.02s]  oh you're just not going to feel good
[4474.02s -> 4475.62s]  for a week or whatever yeah
[4475.62s -> 4479.86s]  it's like no I mean it's been like
[4479.86s -> 4481.86s]  two and a half years since Colorado
[4481.86s -> 4483.54s]  and I feel like I still have issues
[4483.54s -> 4485.86s]  from Colorado really it's like these
[4485.86s -> 4486.50s]  things
[4486.50s -> 4489.30s]  these things can damage your body and
[4489.30s -> 4490.90s]  your mind I feel like I have
[4490.90s -> 4494.02s]  in a way I feel like I have like
[4494.02s -> 4496.74s]  a trail runner's PTSD like if I'm out
[4496.74s -> 4497.94s]  in the middle of the night
[4497.94s -> 4499.78s]  running like at Cocodona or something
[4499.78s -> 4501.22s]  like I'll have these moments where my
[4501.22s -> 4503.86s]  mind like in the headlamp
[4503.86s -> 4506.26s]  bubble really we're all like snapped
[4506.26s -> 4508.34s]  back to Colorado and like my body
[4508.34s -> 4512.10s]  will react with like this like
[4512.10s -> 4513.78s]  like it has like it'll start shutting
[4513.78s -> 4515.22s]  down it's like you have to stop we
[4515.22s -> 4516.74s]  have to get out of here we have to
[4516.74s -> 4518.34s]  like we have to stop doing what we're
[4518.34s -> 4519.14s]  doing right now
[4519.14s -> 4521.62s]  and it's like and it's like I mean I
[4521.62s -> 4523.14s]  don't mean to like use that term
[4523.14s -> 4524.82s]  lightly and compare it to like people
[4524.82s -> 4527.06s]  who actually have like PTSD but it's
[4527.06s -> 4528.18s]  like it's just trail running or
[4528.18s -> 4529.78s]  whatever but it's like right
[4529.78s -> 4532.18s]  I feel like your body's reacting to
[4532.18s -> 4532.90s]  something
[4532.90s -> 4534.66s]  yeah like my body is like reacting
[4534.66s -> 4538.26s]  to this like mental like sort of
[4538.26s -> 4540.42s]  thing that I've like put it through
[4540.42s -> 4543.62s]  and yeah and I mean I haven't
[4543.62s -> 4545.06s]  really been able to do
[4545.06s -> 4546.98s]  very much in ultra running since
[4546.98s -> 4549.06s]  Colorado to be honest it's like I
[4549.06s -> 4552.10s]  sort of
[4552.58s -> 4554.98s]  so it in a lot of ways it sort of feels
[4554.98s -> 4556.66s]  like I've had to like relearn how to
[4556.66s -> 4558.58s]  be an ultra runner I've had to
[4558.58s -> 4560.90s]  relearn how to find motivation because
[4560.90s -> 4562.74s]  I don't have motivation really much to
[4562.74s -> 4564.98s]  like do these things anymore like
[4564.98s -> 4567.06s]  like and actually I talked to Jamil
[4567.06s -> 4570.50s]  about this a lot where it's like
[4570.50s -> 4573.38s]  you know when we it's hard for
[4573.38s -> 4576.74s]  I think it's interesting the guys who
[4576.74s -> 4579.30s]  have run like 200 hundred milers or
[4579.30s -> 4582.66s]  you know you see these things is like
[4582.66s -> 4584.82s]  it's just interesting in the sense of
[4584.82s -> 4586.58s]  like what are you gaining
[4586.58s -> 4588.58s]  from doing something for the 200th
[4588.58s -> 4590.18s]  time and again
[4590.18s -> 4592.58s]  it's like I'm not trying to tear
[4592.58s -> 4593.86s]  that down at all
[4593.86s -> 4595.70s]  sure you know but I but I do know
[4595.70s -> 4597.94s]  that like for myself like
[4597.94s -> 4600.74s]  when I've done a lot in
[4600.74s -> 4603.22s]  ultra running I've done a lot of
[4603.22s -> 4606.26s]  really hard really long stuff and
[4606.82s -> 4609.22s]  it's all like completely humbling it's
[4609.22s -> 4610.82s]  all like
[4610.82s -> 4613.86s]  I'm I think I'm better for it having
[4613.86s -> 4615.46s]  gone through a lot of that stuff
[4615.46s -> 4618.58s]  but yeah like when I finish 100 miler
[4618.58s -> 4619.86s]  now like I don't leave
[4619.86s -> 4622.50s]  that race feeling like I have had
[4622.50s -> 4623.46s]  this like some
[4623.46s -> 4626.90s]  like life-changing like experience
[4626.90s -> 4627.70s]  interesting you know what I mean it's
[4627.70s -> 4629.30s]  like oh I'm done yeah all right
[4629.30s -> 4630.26s]  like
[4630.26s -> 4633.38s]  you know I did it again you know and
[4633.38s -> 4634.74s]  it's like that was hard and it kind
[4634.74s -> 4635.86s]  of sucked
[4635.86s -> 4638.66s]  yeah you know it's like so when when you
[4638.66s -> 4640.10s]  have when you learn these things about
[4640.10s -> 4641.78s]  yourself and you like move forward and
[4641.78s -> 4643.46s]  you have that confidence that you
[4643.46s -> 4645.06s]  could finish if you want to like
[4645.06s -> 4646.58s]  where's the motivation to like put
[4646.58s -> 4647.78s]  yourself through that because you're
[4647.78s -> 4648.42s]  not
[4648.42s -> 4649.86s]  a lot of the payoffs or a lot of
[4649.86s -> 4651.94s]  the positives that come from ultra
[4651.94s -> 4653.06s]  running
[4653.06s -> 4654.98s]  like you don't I don't necessarily
[4654.98s -> 4657.14s]  like continue to relive that I don't
[4657.14s -> 4658.90s]  get a lot of the positives now when I
[4658.90s -> 4660.10s]  finish things
[4660.10s -> 4661.86s]  I'm just out there like suffering
[4661.86s -> 4663.78s]  it actually reminded me of like like
[4663.78s -> 4665.38s]  I used to hitchhike a lot when I was
[4665.38s -> 4665.86s]  younger
[4665.86s -> 4669.70s]  like like 20 to 20 like
[4669.70s -> 4671.62s]  18 to probably like mid-20s like I
[4671.62s -> 4672.82s]  just hitchhiked everywhere
[4672.82s -> 4674.98s]  and it's like like I used to feel
[4674.98s -> 4676.18s]  like this like really
[4676.18s -> 4678.18s]  adventurous like young man like out
[4678.18s -> 4679.70s]  like hitchhiking and doing things
[4679.70s -> 4680.90s]  and then when you do anything for
[4680.90s -> 4682.98s]  long enough it's like
[4682.98s -> 4685.62s]  like well like the novelty of it
[4685.62s -> 4686.50s]  wears off
[4686.50s -> 4688.10s]  and it's like now I'm just sitting
[4688.10s -> 4689.78s]  here waiting for a ride like this
[4689.78s -> 4691.06s]  isn't fun
[4691.06s -> 4692.58s]  yeah you know I'm just sitting on the
[4692.58s -> 4694.10s]  side of a highway on the
[4694.10s -> 4696.02s]  Navajo reservation for four hours
[4696.02s -> 4697.38s]  waiting for a ride like eating
[4697.38s -> 4699.46s]  the second it becomes like everyday
[4699.46s -> 4700.34s]  life like
[4700.34s -> 4702.42s]  expected no surprises nothing unique
[4702.42s -> 4703.54s]  the thrill is gone
[4703.54s -> 4706.82s]  yeah then yes yeah so like so
[4706.82s -> 4708.26s]  I guess where I'm going with it all of
[4708.26s -> 4709.62s]  this is like with with ultra
[4709.62s -> 4711.06s]  running like how do I like find
[4711.06s -> 4712.42s]  motivation
[4712.42s -> 4713.30s]  like where where does the
[4713.30s -> 4715.06s]  motivation come from and it's like
[4715.06s -> 4716.50s]  it's it's an interesting thing for
[4716.50s -> 4718.58s]  the aging ultra runner to like keep
[4718.58s -> 4720.50s]  up that motivation to continue to put
[4720.50s -> 4722.18s]  your mind and body
[4722.18s -> 4724.10s]  because I say think I also say
[4724.10s -> 4725.94s]  something that's a little controversial
[4725.94s -> 4727.86s]  to some people I guess I don't know why
[4727.86s -> 4729.06s]  it's controversial but
[4729.06s -> 4731.06s]  like I think training for ultra
[4731.06s -> 4732.02s]  marathons is
[4732.02s -> 4733.62s]  is like one of the healthiest things
[4733.62s -> 4735.30s]  you can do as a human being
[4735.30s -> 4736.50s]  it's like you're out there like
[4736.50s -> 4738.02s]  active and you're like running around
[4738.02s -> 4739.54s]  all the time and it's great
[4739.54s -> 4741.78s]  I think the act of actually running
[4741.78s -> 4743.78s]  the ultra marathon is not good for
[4743.78s -> 4744.34s]  you
[4744.34s -> 4746.42s]  yeah I think running 100 miles in a
[4746.42s -> 4748.34s]  24 hour period is not a good thing
[4748.34s -> 4749.14s]  for your body
[4749.14s -> 4752.18s]  I think running 250 miles in three days
[4752.18s -> 4754.10s]  across Arizona is not good for your
[4754.10s -> 4754.66s]  body
[4754.66s -> 4757.14s]  yeah I think running 500 miles in a
[4757.14s -> 4758.82s]  week and a hundred thousand feet of
[4758.82s -> 4760.58s]  climbing in Colorado is not good for
[4760.58s -> 4761.94s]  your body like these things are not
[4761.94s -> 4762.66s]  good for you
[4762.66s -> 4766.26s]  and it's like um so like why am I
[4766.26s -> 4768.02s]  continuing to put myself through
[4768.02s -> 4768.74s]  things
[4768.74s -> 4771.30s]  that are clearly bad for me
[4771.30s -> 4774.02s]  physically mentally and emotionally
[4774.02s -> 4775.94s]  and I'm not getting I'm not getting
[4775.94s -> 4777.14s]  the positives
[4777.14s -> 4778.90s]  right because I don't care about my
[4778.90s -> 4780.98s]  name being on FKT's website
[4780.98s -> 4782.42s]  because I like I don't care about
[4782.42s -> 4784.02s]  getting like
[4784.02s -> 4786.10s]  you know yeah I don't care about
[4786.10s -> 4789.22s]  getting like adoration on Instagram
[4789.22s -> 4790.66s]  like I don't care like once you
[4790.66s -> 4792.50s]  stop caring about a lot of those
[4792.50s -> 4793.06s]  things
[4793.06s -> 4794.02s]  and you're not getting the
[4794.02s -> 4795.94s]  positives of ultra running like why
[4795.94s -> 4797.70s]  are we continuing to do this year
[4797.70s -> 4799.86s]  after year after year after year
[4799.86s -> 4802.50s]  yeah I feel like that's a good a
[4802.50s -> 4803.30s]  good kind of
[4803.30s -> 4807.62s]  last question here then is what
[4807.62s -> 4809.14s]  I you know I kind of have my summary at
[4809.14s -> 4810.26s]  this point based off of our
[4810.26s -> 4811.62s]  conversation
[4811.62s -> 4813.06s]  what are the things that you do care
[4813.06s -> 4815.06s]  about like what are the things that
[4815.06s -> 4817.06s]  do get you out of bed related to
[4817.06s -> 4818.26s]  ultra running like
[4818.26s -> 4819.86s]  and this is the synthesis of our
[4819.86s -> 4821.38s]  whole conversation but you know how
[4821.38s -> 4821.86s]  would you
[4821.86s -> 4823.54s]  how would you word that yeah no I
[4823.54s -> 4825.62s]  mean I do care about ultra running
[4825.62s -> 4827.22s]  obviously it's become a huge part of
[4827.22s -> 4828.90s]  my life and it's become a huge part
[4828.90s -> 4829.38s]  of my
[4829.38s -> 4830.98s]  identity for lack of a but I don't
[4830.98s -> 4832.58s]  like that word but for lack of a
[4832.58s -> 4834.50s]  better word and it's like
[4834.50s -> 4838.74s]  uh but like
[4838.74s -> 4843.14s]  I care about like I care about
[4843.14s -> 4845.30s]  being able to get a text message from
[4845.30s -> 4846.66s]  Jamil saying hey do you want to do
[4846.66s -> 4848.42s]  this race and being able to do that
[4848.42s -> 4851.06s]  I care about a friend
[4851.06s -> 4853.14s]  flying into town and getting a text
[4853.14s -> 4854.10s]  and saying hey we're going to the
[4854.10s -> 4856.02s]  Grand Canyon tomorrow do you want to
[4856.02s -> 4859.06s]  do you want to go climb Zoraster do
[4859.06s -> 4860.26s]  you want to go run something you know
[4860.26s -> 4861.54s]  what I mean it's like you want like
[4861.54s -> 4863.78s]  and being able like I care about being
[4863.78s -> 4865.38s]  healthy and being fit and being able
[4865.38s -> 4866.98s]  to do those things
[4866.98s -> 4870.74s]  I care about like showing up and like
[4870.74s -> 4873.62s]  seeing the people that I've like
[4873.62s -> 4874.90s]  become friends with
[4874.90s -> 4877.14s]  at Aravaipa and like being able to
[4877.14s -> 4878.66s]  like engage with them and feel like
[4878.66s -> 4880.10s]  they're appreciative of the fact
[4880.10s -> 4881.22s]  that I'm there
[4881.22s -> 4882.66s]  yeah also like me feeling
[4882.66s -> 4884.34s]  appreciative that I can like
[4884.34s -> 4887.78s]  be there and you know and and like
[4887.78s -> 4892.10s]  I care about like creating
[4892.10s -> 4894.74s]  things in trail running that are more
[4894.74s -> 4897.46s]  genuine and authentic than just like
[4897.46s -> 4900.98s]  you know by this by the shoe
[4900.98s -> 4902.82s]  right you know what I mean I care
[4902.82s -> 4905.22s]  about like bringing things to Prescott
[4905.22s -> 4906.90s]  that are more than like Trump
[4906.90s -> 4909.06s]  rallies and vape shops
[4909.06s -> 4911.38s]  I care about like you know like I do
[4911.38s -> 4913.54s]  care about things like for sure
[4913.54s -> 4915.22s]  yeah but a lot of that doesn't have
[4915.22s -> 4916.90s]  to do with like my own like sort of
[4916.90s -> 4918.98s]  personal performance and like
[4918.98s -> 4921.38s]  receiving adoration for being a good
[4921.38s -> 4923.06s]  runner or for being
[4923.06s -> 4927.22s]  um like and I get that I've like
[4927.22s -> 4928.74s]  I mean I mean getting attention for
[4928.74s -> 4930.82s]  things feels good right it's like
[4930.82s -> 4932.98s]  it's why it's why I've it's why a
[4932.98s -> 4935.06s]  lot of us run ultra marathons it's
[4935.06s -> 4936.18s]  why
[4936.18s -> 4938.34s]  people put bumper stickers on their
[4938.34s -> 4940.34s]  cars it's like why it's why
[4940.34s -> 4942.34s]  all any of us have a social media
[4942.34s -> 4944.98s]  it's like there's something
[4944.98s -> 4947.14s]  even though a guy like me would like
[4947.14s -> 4949.94s]  like tends to tear down the behavior of
[4949.94s -> 4950.90s]  like
[4950.90s -> 4954.74s]  of of blatantly
[4954.74s -> 4957.38s]  wanting attention like like being loud
[4957.38s -> 4958.82s]  obnoxious people you know what I
[4958.82s -> 4960.82s]  mean yeah but but it's like
[4960.82s -> 4962.42s]  there's something about human nature
[4962.42s -> 4963.86s]  that craves attention for whatever
[4963.86s -> 4965.46s]  reason that is that's like a true
[4965.46s -> 4967.62s]  thing about like the human psyche is
[4967.62s -> 4968.18s]  like
[4968.18s -> 4969.86s]  receiving attention for things feels
[4969.86s -> 4971.86s]  good but like
[4971.86s -> 4974.26s]  but again as I think I'm a person
[4974.26s -> 4976.10s]  who's like received a lot of attention
[4976.10s -> 4977.86s]  for things and like I've like that
[4977.86s -> 4981.22s]  does feel good but it also like
[4981.22s -> 4984.18s]  like a person like me can sort of
[4984.18s -> 4985.14s]  like observe
[4985.14s -> 4987.70s]  observe that and like take that in
[4987.70s -> 4989.94s]  and realize that like that's not a
[4989.94s -> 4990.82s]  great thing
[4990.82s -> 4994.02s]  to be like a motivator for me to
[4994.02s -> 4996.10s]  like continue to do things like
[4996.10s -> 4999.06s]  yeah I need I like if I become
[4999.06s -> 5000.98s]  addicted to like receiving attention
[5000.98s -> 5002.74s]  from people because of my own like
[5002.74s -> 5004.50s]  personal achievements you know that
[5004.50s -> 5006.50s]  and that was a huge thing that happened
[5006.50s -> 5008.02s]  to me in the middle of the Colorado
[5008.02s -> 5009.22s]  run
[5009.22s -> 5010.82s]  was like it wasn't just about me is
[5010.82s -> 5012.82s]  like there was like you know
[5012.82s -> 5017.70s]  six to ten other people on the crew
[5017.70s -> 5020.18s]  there putting themselves through hell
[5020.18s -> 5020.98s]  for a week
[5020.98s -> 5024.26s]  yeah trying to support me and and
[5024.26s -> 5026.10s]  why am I doing this like all of this
[5026.10s -> 5028.02s]  is like ego-based all of this is so
[5028.02s -> 5029.70s]  that like I can have my name in
[5029.70s -> 5032.10s]  front of somebody else's name
[5032.10s -> 5035.06s]  all of this is like so when you stop
[5035.06s -> 5036.82s]  caring about that when you stop
[5036.82s -> 5039.14s]  where I shouldn't say you stop caring
[5039.14s -> 5040.42s]  about that
[5040.42s -> 5042.42s]  you just realize that like that's not
[5042.42s -> 5044.82s]  necessarily the most like healthy
[5044.82s -> 5046.82s]  outlook or like mentality that you
[5046.82s -> 5048.02s]  should embrace and you should
[5048.02s -> 5048.82s]  actually
[5048.82s -> 5050.82s]  try your best to like keep that at
[5050.82s -> 5053.22s]  arm's distance to like
[5053.22s -> 5057.14s]  um you
[5057.14s -> 5058.98s]  you begin to fall into what I've
[5058.98s -> 5060.98s]  fallen into which is like
[5060.98s -> 5064.98s]  you begin to fall into the um
[5064.98s -> 5066.98s]  like like to set an fkt on the
[5066.98s -> 5068.98s]  Colorado trail you have to be
[5068.98s -> 5072.58s]  you have to be obsessed with that yes
[5072.58s -> 5073.94s]  you know what I mean that has to be
[5073.94s -> 5076.74s]  like at all costs
[5076.74s -> 5079.06s]  like nothing else fucking matters like
[5079.06s -> 5080.58s]  at all costs
[5080.58s -> 5083.30s]  and beating I mean and this is sport
[5083.30s -> 5084.98s]  in general this is like this is
[5084.98s -> 5086.82s]  competitiveness in general like if you
[5086.82s -> 5088.26s]  want to be the best at anything or
[5088.26s -> 5090.42s]  have your name on anything like
[5090.42s -> 5091.62s]  and this goes back to what I said
[5091.62s -> 5093.46s]  earlier is like you can't be like this
[5093.46s -> 5096.10s]  like balanced healthy
[5096.10s -> 5098.58s]  yeah person it's just like it's just
[5098.58s -> 5099.94s]  like not the case I actually think
[5099.94s -> 5102.02s]  that's a problem with American sports
[5102.02s -> 5104.26s]  right now yeah in general of all
[5104.26s -> 5106.10s]  levels of like professional
[5106.10s -> 5108.18s]  sports is that I feel like the
[5108.18s -> 5110.34s]  younger generation is like a much more
[5110.34s -> 5114.74s]  like aware and sort of
[5114.74s -> 5117.54s]  like mental health is like this thing
[5117.54s -> 5118.98s]  that's important to them
[5118.98s -> 5121.38s]  yeah so I feel like sport is suffering
[5121.38s -> 5122.90s]  from that
[5122.90s -> 5124.98s]  yeah like like the like there there
[5124.98s -> 5126.18s]  will never be another
[5126.18s -> 5128.50s]  like Kobe Bryant or something you know
[5128.50s -> 5129.70s]  what I mean right
[5129.70s -> 5131.14s]  I've obviously like been watching
[5131.14s -> 5134.10s]  basketball yeah but it's like
[5134.10s -> 5136.66s]  it's like because runners or runner
[5136.66s -> 5138.66s]  well yeah runners but all professional
[5138.66s -> 5140.18s]  athletes are realizing that like
[5140.18s -> 5141.78s]  mental like mental health is a more
[5141.78s -> 5143.94s]  important thing than like
[5143.94s -> 5146.90s]  like winning at all costs
[5146.98s -> 5149.06s]  like sort of thing and so it's like
[5149.06s -> 5151.14s]  but even just like that like sport is
[5151.14s -> 5152.10s]  suffering
[5152.10s -> 5153.94s]  right yeah yeah any but even like you
[5153.94s -> 5155.70s]  said like if if if what you're going
[5155.70s -> 5157.30s]  for is the likes and for people to
[5157.30s -> 5158.66s]  notice you and pay attention to you
[5158.66s -> 5160.02s]  you probably start to do things that
[5160.02s -> 5162.90s]  you that you no longer respect
[5162.90s -> 5164.02s]  in order to if you if you want to
[5164.02s -> 5165.38s]  main you either maintain that or you
[5165.38s -> 5167.78s]  maintain some level of self-respect
[5167.78s -> 5169.06s]  yeah I mean that was a big thing
[5169.06s -> 5171.06s]  for me when I when I was
[5171.06s -> 5173.06s]  before I was with Satisfye and I had
[5173.06s -> 5174.82s]  involvement with other companies was
[5174.82s -> 5176.42s]  like there's a lot of behavior out
[5176.42s -> 5177.62s]  there that I don't admire
[5177.62s -> 5180.74s]  especially on social media yeah and so
[5180.74s -> 5183.86s]  when I when I would catch myself
[5183.86s -> 5187.54s]  behaving like that or when
[5187.54s -> 5189.86s]  when I would unintentionally be out
[5189.86s -> 5191.38s]  in the mountains all day and I would
[5191.38s -> 5192.90s]  be thinking about
[5192.90s -> 5196.50s]  an Instagram like caption yeah
[5196.50s -> 5198.82s]  that to me was like the moment where
[5198.82s -> 5200.82s]  it was like
[5200.82s -> 5202.58s]  what have I become what have I
[5202.58s -> 5204.66s]  become and as critical as I am
[5204.66s -> 5207.78s]  of others I'm a lot more critical of
[5207.78s -> 5208.58s]  myself
[5208.58s -> 5211.06s]  so so when I when I caught myself
[5211.06s -> 5212.82s]  behaving that way
[5212.82s -> 5215.22s]  that's not good for me that like like
[5215.22s -> 5215.94s]  that wasn't
[5215.94s -> 5217.86s]  a good place for me to be in so
[5217.86s -> 5218.98s]  like yeah I
[5218.98s -> 5221.38s]  you know I had to remove a lot of
[5221.38s -> 5222.90s]  that from my life
[5222.90s -> 5227.54s]  yeah but uh yeah so I mean
[5227.54s -> 5228.82s]  I think to go back to your
[5228.82s -> 5231.22s]  question about like what
[5231.22s -> 5233.38s]  you know still motivates me it's sort
[5233.38s -> 5235.06s]  of all of those other things I think
[5235.06s -> 5238.50s]  I think that there's a lot of
[5238.50s -> 5242.34s]  and in a way like the whole
[5242.34s -> 5244.26s]  it's actually funny to me because I
[5244.26s -> 5247.78s]  feel like I've become
[5247.78s -> 5252.26s]  what I hate yeah the most
[5252.26s -> 5255.54s]  but in a way that makes
[5255.54s -> 5260.42s]  sense in a way I feel like
[5260.50s -> 5267.62s]  like I've become an influencer
[5267.62s -> 5269.70s]  more than an athlete right you know you
[5269.70s -> 5270.58s]  know what I mean like
[5270.58s -> 5272.82s]  like obviously like I would never like
[5272.82s -> 5274.58s]  refer to myself as that or like I
[5274.58s -> 5275.78s]  don't think of myself
[5275.78s -> 5278.02s]  of that but you have influence but
[5278.02s -> 5279.30s]  like why why
[5279.30s -> 5281.86s]  why am I why do I get paid to be a
[5281.86s -> 5282.90s]  trail runner
[5282.90s -> 5285.22s]  yeah I don't win races so like
[5285.22s -> 5287.22s]  everything they're like I criticize
[5287.22s -> 5289.30s]  in like today's world of like social
[5289.30s -> 5290.98s]  media and just like today's world in
[5290.98s -> 5292.74s]  general is like I've sort of become
[5292.74s -> 5294.74s]  that
[5294.74s -> 5296.82s]  and I think for not the same reasons
[5296.82s -> 5298.82s]  and and and like I don't think I do
[5298.82s -> 5300.02s]  it the same way
[5300.02s -> 5301.70s]  right but it's sort of this like funny
[5301.70s -> 5303.78s]  like full circle sort of thing where
[5303.78s -> 5306.34s]  it's like
[5306.34s -> 5309.22s]  well maybe maybe runners not being
[5309.22s -> 5310.26s]  the best
[5310.26s -> 5312.74s]  and still getting the attention is
[5312.74s -> 5313.86s]  actually good
[5313.86s -> 5315.86s]  yeah you know what I mean like maybe
[5315.86s -> 5317.78s]  there's a broader landscape
[5318.02s -> 5321.46s]  in trail running of like intent and
[5321.46s -> 5324.58s]  motives and like interesting characters
[5324.58s -> 5329.14s]  maybe that's like a better way to like
[5329.14s -> 5332.66s]  and I mean and I mean I still I still
[5332.66s -> 5333.78s]  like and that's another thing too is
[5333.78s -> 5334.90s]  like I don't think I'm like that
[5334.90s -> 5336.34s]  interest that that interesting
[5336.34s -> 5337.94s]  compared to like a lot of
[5337.94s -> 5340.34s]  people you go back into the mid and
[5340.34s -> 5341.86s]  the back of the packs of any race
[5341.86s -> 5343.86s]  like there's a much more interesting
[5343.86s -> 5347.38s]  and better motivated people than I am
[5347.38s -> 5349.70s]  but because I've been able to like
[5349.70s -> 5351.54s]  sort of carve out this area of like
[5351.54s -> 5353.06s]  having these like different motives
[5353.06s -> 5355.14s]  but I still am able to sort of kind of
[5355.14s -> 5356.10s]  compete
[5356.10s -> 5358.74s]  yeah yeah yeah that's like that's
[5358.74s -> 5359.86s]  intriguing
[5359.86s -> 5363.78s]  so like but yeah
[5363.78s -> 5368.10s]  like yeah I mean I think sport in
[5368.10s -> 5370.10s]  general and again like trail running
[5370.10s -> 5371.46s]  like ultra running
[5371.46s -> 5374.50s]  in general like I find it interesting
[5374.58s -> 5378.90s]  that a sport that has defined itself by
[5378.90s -> 5380.66s]  like endurance
[5380.66s -> 5384.26s]  yeah is obsessed
[5384.26s -> 5386.90s]  with speed like I like I get it
[5386.90s -> 5387.94s]  interesting
[5387.94s -> 5389.22s]  you know what I mean like like I
[5389.22s -> 5391.46s]  understand like speed is how
[5391.46s -> 5394.18s]  sport is measured right you know
[5394.18s -> 5396.42s]  what I mean but like
[5396.42s -> 5398.10s]  I actually remember to bring up Carl
[5398.10s -> 5399.54s]  again I remember it was like
[5399.54s -> 5400.98s]  I remember this conversation I think
[5400.98s -> 5402.98s]  it was with Ricky Gates because I
[5402.98s -> 5404.82s]  like we actually like disagreed over
[5404.82s -> 5405.94s]  this
[5405.94s -> 5408.18s]  where it was uh it was like FKT had
[5408.18s -> 5408.74s]  just
[5408.74s -> 5410.98s]  announced their like FKT of the year
[5410.98s -> 5412.58s]  award or whatever and it was like
[5412.58s -> 5414.66s]  the two that the two that it was like
[5414.66s -> 5415.46s]  down to
[5415.46s -> 5417.14s]  or whatever it was it was either
[5417.14s -> 5419.30s]  Carl's Appalachian Trail
[5419.30s -> 5422.18s]  or Jim's Rim to Rim to Rim okay
[5422.18s -> 5424.66s]  and I was like how can anyone
[5424.66s -> 5425.54s]  possibly
[5425.54s -> 5429.38s]  like like there no one understands
[5429.38s -> 5430.50s]  what Carl like
[5430.50s -> 5433.78s]  no one understands what a long trail
[5433.78s -> 5436.50s]  FKT is except for the very small number
[5436.50s -> 5436.98s]  of people
[5436.98s -> 5438.98s]  who have put themselves through that
[5438.98s -> 5441.22s]  yeah an idea that anyone could think
[5441.22s -> 5443.06s]  running six hours across the Grand
[5443.06s -> 5445.06s]  Canyon
[5445.06s -> 5447.22s]  like is on the same page and even
[5447.22s -> 5449.14s]  touch that as running
[5449.14s -> 5453.86s]  like like 2000 fucking miles
[5453.86s -> 5455.94s]  and how how has our sport which is
[5455.94s -> 5457.78s]  like supposedly embracing endurance
[5457.78s -> 5459.86s]  like how are we more like
[5459.94s -> 5462.90s]  into speed into what Jim did
[5462.90s -> 5464.58s]  and again not taking anything away from
[5464.58s -> 5466.34s]  no I get it that's an excellent
[5466.34s -> 5468.66s]  point it's so insane to run six hours
[5468.66s -> 5469.86s]  Rim to Rim to Rim
[5469.86s -> 5471.46s]  yeah but it's like it's just like
[5471.46s -> 5473.46s]  how like
[5473.46s -> 5476.58s]  like and it wasn't until my first
[5476.58s -> 5477.86s]  experience of doing that like
[5477.86s -> 5479.70s]  multi-day running like it yeah like
[5479.70s -> 5481.30s]  I remember after doing the Arizona
[5481.30s -> 5483.70s]  Trail which was like
[5483.70s -> 5486.58s]  um it completely changed what I
[5486.58s -> 5488.26s]  thought I knew about endurance
[5488.26s -> 5491.62s]  like I thought endurance was like and I
[5491.62s -> 5494.50s]  this is like going to sound like very
[5494.50s -> 5497.30s]  you know I don't know what it's going
[5497.30s -> 5498.74s]  to sound like but it's like
[5499.70s -> 5501.06s]  I remember saying after that just
[5501.06s -> 5502.58s]  being like I don't think anything you
[5502.58s -> 5504.42s]  can do in a 24-hour period is
[5504.42s -> 5504.98s]  endurance
[5506.58s -> 5511.06s]  like it completely changed because
[5511.06s -> 5513.62s]  because running 100 miles or running
[5513.62s -> 5515.78s]  for a sub 24-hour experience and then
[5515.78s -> 5517.70s]  laying in bed for two weeks is like
[5517.70s -> 5518.50s]  not this like
[5519.30s -> 5520.90s]  that's not really that wasn't like
[5520.90s -> 5522.58s]  really endurance to me that's just
[5522.58s -> 5524.98s]  destroying yourself in a 24-hour period
[5524.98s -> 5526.98s]  and then recovering for a long time
[5526.98s -> 5528.90s]  yeah when you get into the multi-day
[5528.90s -> 5531.06s]  thing like sustainability becomes a
[5531.06s -> 5532.90s]  significantly more important thing you
[5532.90s -> 5534.26s]  have to get up every day
[5534.26s -> 5536.42s]  keep doing it every day keep doing
[5536.42s -> 5538.26s]  it that's endurance
[5538.26s -> 5540.98s]  yeah and so like it it's a
[5540.98s -> 5542.74s]  completely different thing that's why
[5542.74s -> 5544.74s]  100 milers you know like I remember
[5544.74s -> 5545.54s]  talking to
[5545.54s -> 5548.66s]  uh eric senseman when he was running
[5548.66s -> 5549.30s]  coca-dona
[5550.42s -> 5552.26s]  it's like obviously like a good runner
[5552.26s -> 5553.14s]  you know what I mean but but
[5553.70s -> 5555.62s]  to like use him as an example like
[5557.06s -> 5558.58s]  it's what I said earlier about how
[5558.58s -> 5560.42s]  running coca-dona is not running
[5560.42s -> 5562.58s]  100 miles two and a half times it's
[5562.58s -> 5564.66s]  like it's a completely different
[5564.66s -> 5566.58s]  sport it's a completely different
[5566.58s -> 5567.70s]  approach it's like
[5568.34s -> 5570.66s]  you have to change everything it's also
[5570.66s -> 5572.58s]  why the like people like even like
[5572.58s -> 5573.78s]  string bean you know like I don't
[5573.78s -> 5575.78s]  think like string being that good at
[5575.78s -> 5578.10s]  like 100 milers or whatever it's like
[5578.10s -> 5580.18s]  because doing something in a 24-hour
[5580.18s -> 5581.78s]  period where you're not resting
[5581.78s -> 5583.14s]  you're not having to recover and get
[5583.14s -> 5584.74s]  up and doing it again is completely
[5584.74s -> 5585.62s]  different it's just
[5585.62s -> 5587.86s]  totally different yes or so yeah
[5588.90s -> 5591.94s]  um I had Candice Burt on the
[5591.94s -> 5593.78s]  podcast last week and she was
[5593.78s -> 5594.66s]  trying to talk me into it because
[5594.66s -> 5596.18s]  I'm not a good 100 miler
[5596.18s -> 5597.62s]  she's but as we talked about it
[5597.62s -> 5598.74s]  she's like you maybe you probably
[5598.74s -> 5600.26s]  really like the 200 then
[5600.26s -> 5602.10s]  yeah no I've had people talk to me
[5602.10s -> 5603.62s]  about that or ask me about
[5603.62s -> 5605.22s]  that and I've said the same thing I
[5605.22s -> 5605.86s]  was like
[5605.86s -> 5607.62s]  so I had friends you know especially
[5607.62s -> 5608.90s]  like around Prescott because they've
[5608.90s -> 5610.66s]  like seen coca-dona and they you
[5610.66s -> 5612.34s]  know they know me and like yeah like
[5612.34s -> 5613.14s]  that and
[5613.14s -> 5615.30s]  I've had a handful of friends around
[5615.30s -> 5616.82s]  Prescott run coca-dona and I
[5616.82s -> 5618.02s]  remember before
[5618.02s -> 5619.78s]  before them running it's probably
[5619.78s -> 5621.22s]  similar to what Candice said to you
[5621.22s -> 5621.86s]  or it's like
[5622.74s -> 5624.82s]  uh yeah the multi-day thing
[5625.70s -> 5628.10s]  you know you might be really good at
[5628.10s -> 5628.74s]  it yeah
[5629.30s -> 5630.82s]  you know you just don't know and
[5630.82s -> 5632.66s]  until you like go through that and do
[5632.66s -> 5634.02s]  that and typically it's not
[5634.74s -> 5636.98s]  the people who are good ultra runners
[5636.98s -> 5639.38s]  right yeah that's interesting
[5640.18s -> 5641.46s]  well that that feels like a good note
[5641.46s -> 5642.02s]  to end on
[5642.82s -> 5645.54s]  I uh man I really appreciate all your
[5645.54s -> 5646.90s]  time I'm stoked to to go back
[5646.90s -> 5647.62s]  through all this and
[5648.34s -> 5650.34s]  um be watching you at coca-dona and
[5650.34s -> 5651.70s]  maybe see you at Zion
[5651.70s -> 5652.82s]  if you mark the course or if you're
[5652.82s -> 5653.94s]  ever up in Salt Lake let me know if
[5653.94s -> 5655.46s]  I'm ever in Prescott I don't
[5655.46s -> 5657.22s]  I looked at I looked at it on a map
[5657.22s -> 5659.06s]  and I don't know if I will just be
[5659.06s -> 5660.34s]  crossing through anytime soon but if
[5660.34s -> 5661.54s]  so I'll I'll look you up
[5662.90s -> 5665.14s]  cool yeah uh like I said I think I'll
[5665.14s -> 5666.10s]  be at Zion
