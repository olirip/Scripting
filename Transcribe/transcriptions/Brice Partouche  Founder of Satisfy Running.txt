[87.26s -> 89.54s]  Brice Partouche, welcome to the Freetrail podcast.
[89.54s -> 91.30s]  It's nice to see you.
[91.30s -> 94.18s]  Thank you. Nice to see you too, Dylan.
[94.18s -> 96.46s]  Thank you for having me.
[96.46s -> 99.14s]  Very happy to be to be with you.
[99.14s -> 101.58s]  Yeah, I've been very excited to have you on.
[101.58s -> 105.26s]  You, of course, are the founder of Satisfy Running, a relatively new but
[105.26s -> 109.94s]  exciting apparel brand that has firmly established itself in the running
[109.94s -> 111.86s]  space that we'll talk all about.
[111.86s -> 116.46s]  I want to hear about the origin story, the challenges and successes that
[116.46s -> 117.78s]  you've had along the way.
[117.78s -> 121.14s]  But in an effort to first introduce you to the Freetrail audience, I want
[121.14s -> 125.26s]  to pose a simple introspective question to get things started.
[125.26s -> 127.66s]  And that is what makes you you, Brice?
[127.66s -> 132.22s]  What makes Brice Partouche a singular person in the world?
[132.22s -> 134.22s]  That's a deep question.
[134.22s -> 139.90s]  I hope I won't be too long or too annoying.
[139.90s -> 143.14s]  Well, that's a good question, actually.
[143.14s -> 148.38s]  I mean, I guess like like everybody else, I think what makes you you is,
[148.38s -> 152.02s]  you know, of course, you have like the science and you have your
[152.02s -> 155.54s]  genes, but the background, the culture, the references.
[155.54s -> 163.18s]  I mean, I think at least for me, this is what makes me who I am.
[163.18s -> 168.78s]  But the thing I think it's not only that, of course, it's like what,
[168.78s -> 174.06s]  you know, I think what defines me or makes me like unique is what I'm
[174.06s -> 178.78s]  doing with it, like what what I'm doing with like my background, my
[178.78s -> 182.38s]  culture, like and the connection I make.
[182.38s -> 187.50s]  And and I think this is what makes people unique, like like the
[187.50s -> 190.70s]  background side of things, the culture, like how you grew up,
[190.70s -> 191.90s]  like, you know, whatever.
[191.90s -> 194.94s]  But also what you're going to do with all of this, you know, so you
[194.94s -> 196.90s]  can transform it into something.
[196.90s -> 200.42s]  And I think I'm I think I'm a builder.
[200.42s -> 206.38s]  I like to build things like, you know, I like to build like stories,
[206.38s -> 209.50s]  companies, RC cars, you know, whatever.
[209.50s -> 211.38s]  I like I like to build stuff.
[211.38s -> 217.46s]  And and and and yeah, and I think what I build is also like
[217.46s -> 222.38s]  unique because of my references and my and my and my culture.
[222.38s -> 227.58s]  And I guess I've been satisfied from, of course, my experience with
[227.58s -> 235.70s]  running, but I think I also I did all my like cultural references.
[235.70s -> 239.98s]  So I like the mix of like bringing cultural values to the
[239.98s -> 242.30s]  things I'm I'm building.
[242.30s -> 244.06s]  Yeah, very cool.
[244.06s -> 245.02s]  Well, thanks for that.
[245.02s -> 249.18s]  You and I spoke last week and you said that you were heavily
[249.22s -> 253.42s]  influenced in your youth by music and skateboarding.
[253.42s -> 258.98s]  And both of those obviously have the cultural element baked into
[258.98s -> 260.22s]  the practice itself.
[260.22s -> 264.26s]  Maybe give us a deeper sense of your personal history and explain
[264.26s -> 269.07s]  what role music and skateboarding played in it.
[269.07s -> 275.55s]  Well, I I started to play music when I was 13 or 14.
[275.55s -> 279.03s]  And at the exact same time, I started to skateboard.
[279.03s -> 283.03s]  And before skateboarding, like, you know, I was doing like handball.
[283.03s -> 287.59s]  I played also baseball, you know, in my in the local like team in Grenoble.
[287.59s -> 291.71s]  So I'm from the Alps, Grenoble, which is like not a small town,
[291.71s -> 297.47s]  but like 500,000 people live in Grenoble.
[297.47s -> 301.35s]  But it's a it's a nice city surrounded by mountains.
[301.35s -> 308.07s]  So I grew up with like the culture of like the outdoors culture.
[308.07s -> 313.07s]  But at that at this age, I was refusing this creature.
[313.07s -> 317.55s]  Like I always like skied or snowboarded, you know,
[317.55s -> 320.19s]  but I mean, skied first about it came later.
[320.51s -> 325.03s]  And I became like more like into this creature when I started to skateboard,
[325.03s -> 328.67s]  because then I started also to snowboard.
[328.87s -> 330.99s]  And then I became friends with the mountains.
[330.99s -> 335.51s]  But before that, I I had this kind of like I was rejecting this
[335.71s -> 340.43s]  because my dream was not to become like, I don't know, like a trail runner
[340.43s -> 344.19s]  or like, you know, or doing like heights and stuff.
[344.19s -> 345.71s]  Like I was really into music.
[345.71s -> 351.15s]  I I was in I was playing drums in some like heavy metal and hardcore
[351.15s -> 357.39s]  and turn bands, you know, and this is what I wanted to do of my life.
[359.23s -> 361.59s]  But at the same time, I was also studying.
[362.23s -> 364.19s]  I went to medical school
[366.19s -> 369.47s]  so, yeah, you know, you you you you asked me earlier
[369.47s -> 371.07s]  what makes you also like unique?
[371.07s -> 375.39s]  I think it's that this weird combination of like me being
[375.39s -> 378.67s]  like me wanting to be like a surgeon, but at the same time
[378.95s -> 381.35s]  playing in hardcore bands and skateboarding, you know.
[383.15s -> 385.99s]  But to circle back to your to your to your question.
[387.11s -> 388.91s]  Yeah, music.
[388.91s -> 392.59s]  You know, I think I always been into music.
[392.91s -> 395.87s]  I think I discovered like music with a bitter.
[395.87s -> 400.03s]  So when I was like eight and then the Rolling Stones and then like ACDC,
[400.91s -> 403.31s]  you know, Metallica and all the things and
[404.51s -> 411.47s]  and the skateboard videos in the 90s or late 80s was all about the music.
[411.47s -> 416.35s]  So you discover like a lot of bands through through skateboard.
[416.35s -> 419.47s]  So you you you are you are like
[419.87s -> 423.47s]  surrounded by this amazing culture, like
[424.67s -> 429.03s]  like fashion, like the style, the brands as skateboard brands,
[429.03s -> 432.07s]  like the the the music, the tricks.
[432.07s -> 436.55s]  It's it's it's amazing, like discovering music and skateboarding
[436.55s -> 438.87s]  when you're like a teenager. It's just amazing.
[439.23s -> 443.51s]  Yeah. So give us a sense of your professional background
[443.51s -> 446.43s]  before we get into the origin story of Satisfy.
[446.43s -> 448.55s]  You said you went to medical school and you were
[449.31s -> 454.91s]  a surgeon, but it seems like you have history working in fashion and media.
[455.99s -> 458.91s]  Yeah. I mean, yeah, let's say like
[459.75s -> 465.11s]  product like I don't really like the the like the naming fashion
[465.11s -> 467.19s]  because I think it's too too wide.
[467.19s -> 470.75s]  I like I like the idea of being like a product person.
[470.75s -> 472.31s]  I like to make products. Yeah.
[472.31s -> 477.79s]  And my my before doing Satisfy had a jeans company.
[477.83s -> 480.67s]  So I failed my medical school
[480.87s -> 484.35s]  and then I played music for for two or three years.
[485.71s -> 488.03s]  And then I started to
[488.03s -> 490.03s]  I was still into like really into skateboarding.
[490.03s -> 493.83s]  And I just started with like making like basically jeans for my friends.
[493.83s -> 497.87s]  And at the time, at the time, we just wanted to look like the Romans,
[497.87s -> 500.67s]  you know, so it was all about like skinny jeans and stuff like this.
[500.87s -> 504.15s]  So I basically started to make like skinny jeans for me and my friends.
[504.39s -> 507.63s]  And we are like in 2000 or 2001.
[507.91s -> 510.95s]  And for some reason, the company
[512.47s -> 513.71s]  like grew.
[513.71s -> 518.43s]  And I did that until like 2017 or something.
[518.63s -> 524.23s]  So 17 years of my life, I spent it like having this brand,
[524.47s -> 526.91s]  which was not fashion because it was like jeans.
[526.91s -> 530.55s]  It was basically just like five pockets, but like made in Japan,
[530.55s -> 533.63s]  like nice fabrics, like very,
[533.63s -> 536.03s]  you know, very also about the culture, about the music.
[536.03s -> 538.07s]  It was also a music label.
[538.07s -> 542.75s]  So we we would like put out some records,
[542.75s -> 545.15s]  like physical music was like seven inch.
[546.83s -> 548.19s]  We had like a few bands.
[548.19s -> 552.43s]  It was a it was a it was not too far from what I'm doing now.
[552.43s -> 553.63s]  It's just a different product.
[553.63s -> 556.03s]  It's going to say it sounds very familiar to you.
[556.79s -> 561.35s]  Yeah, the cultural part was was was there, you know, and
[563.07s -> 565.39s]  but what happened then is
[565.43s -> 570.91s]  I discovered running like I was really not into
[572.99s -> 574.03s]  into running at all.
[574.03s -> 577.11s]  Like I mean, I
[579.03s -> 583.63s]  I mean, it was I don't think running is my point is that
[584.59s -> 587.95s]  I think running is not a sport or it was not a sport for me.
[588.19s -> 591.31s]  But for me, it was
[591.31s -> 594.71s]  a great way to step out from my comfort zone.
[595.11s -> 599.35s]  And my friend at the time,
[599.35s -> 605.07s]  she she she was running and she basically introduced me to running.
[605.39s -> 610.95s]  And I had pretty much like I always had like a pretty much like
[611.63s -> 615.27s]  like a healthy lifestyle, you know, so always been like vegan,
[615.27s -> 617.23s]  vegetarian, like I don't smoke, you know.
[617.23s -> 622.03s]  So starting to run was technically easy for me.
[622.03s -> 624.27s]  It was not too difficult, like physically.
[625.19s -> 628.27s]  What was tough is like I was coming from
[628.87s -> 633.51s]  skateboarding and music where like the culture is very strong to.
[633.99s -> 636.47s]  And I'm talking about world running here, right?
[636.47s -> 639.59s]  Paris, you know, to
[639.59s -> 643.75s]  a culture of performance, you know, like a culture of like score.
[643.95s -> 646.75s]  And when you switch from like punk rock and skateboard,
[646.75s -> 648.03s]  there's no score in punk rock.
[648.03s -> 651.63s]  There's no scoring in skateboarding, you know, unless
[651.87s -> 656.83s]  unless you're you participate in the X Games.
[656.83s -> 658.83s]  But it's not the type of skateboard I like.
[658.99s -> 662.51s]  I like the skateboard, like, you know, with my friends in the street.
[663.99s -> 665.51s]  So there was no score.
[665.51s -> 669.03s]  And switching from that culture to the running culture,
[669.03s -> 672.55s]  where everything is about like not everything, but most of it
[672.55s -> 677.71s]  is about like performance or running clubs, you know, running like all together.
[677.71s -> 680.07s]  And it was really not for me.
[680.47s -> 683.87s]  I liked running alone in the morning.
[684.87s -> 690.23s]  You know, it's it was the only moment of the day when I was with myself.
[690.47s -> 694.03s]  And it's a it's a sacred moment that I don't want to spend
[694.03s -> 696.27s]  with like 20 people, I don't know, you know.
[696.27s -> 697.79s]  And it's not like being antisocial.
[697.79s -> 701.23s]  It's just like it's it's an opportunity to be with yourself.
[701.23s -> 704.71s]  You know, and it's just nice for me.
[704.71s -> 706.67s]  It was more like a big day.
[706.67s -> 709.35s]  Like it's a it's it's it's a meditative
[711.11s -> 716.03s]  take on things, you know, running was not about the performance at all for me.
[716.19s -> 719.23s]  Yeah. It's so funny to hear you talk about it,
[719.23s -> 722.87s]  because everything that you're saying shines through in the brand
[722.87s -> 724.51s]  and the product, it's satisfying.
[724.51s -> 728.27s]  And now this is a perfect opportunity to talk about the origin story.
[728.27s -> 732.75s]  So as you discovered running, you must have been struck with an insight
[732.75s -> 736.35s]  that there was an opportunity in the running apparel space,
[736.35s -> 740.03s]  especially to marry product with culture.
[740.07s -> 743.31s]  Talk about when that insight hit you.
[743.31s -> 746.11s]  Yeah, the thing is, I'm not smart enough to think like this
[746.11s -> 747.83s]  about like opportunities.
[747.83s -> 751.55s]  It's just like when I like something, I really want to be part of it.
[751.55s -> 754.15s]  And I want to build something, you know,
[754.15s -> 756.67s]  and just to connect with the thing I like.
[756.95s -> 761.55s]  Like I didn't do like in the really like strong research
[761.55s -> 764.99s]  or like or like, oh, there's a gap in the market.
[764.99s -> 767.19s]  There's an opportunity to make a business.
[767.19s -> 770.91s]  It was really like I'm just bored with my jeans company.
[770.91s -> 772.79s]  And I love running so much.
[772.79s -> 777.23s]  And I think that I could bring I could help running
[777.43s -> 782.47s]  with my knowledge of like culture and my knowledge was like fabrics and product.
[782.75s -> 785.23s]  I think I can do something better.
[785.55s -> 790.23s]  And I'm sure that I'm not the only one who wants something different.
[791.59s -> 794.47s]  So I was my my my take on that.
[794.67s -> 800.67s]  And yes, so basically, I started to develop products and to design products.
[803.19s -> 807.83s]  Basically, I was just running, going back home and taking notes.
[807.83s -> 809.67s]  OK, today, I don't know.
[809.67s -> 812.59s]  And I was like a newbie, you know, but
[814.19s -> 816.67s]  you know, I discovered soon that like
[818.03s -> 821.31s]  products for running are not really like well designed.
[821.31s -> 824.43s]  Like, you know, my phone was bouncing in my pocket.
[824.47s -> 827.75s]  And I didn't want to wear like one of these like bands.
[829.03s -> 832.19s]  My keys were jingling together, making this horrible noise.
[832.19s -> 833.75s]  Like, you know, everything.
[833.75s -> 837.03s]  And I'm like, wow, like it's I mean, I was wearing like some
[837.03s -> 839.91s]  some like, you know, big brand like shorts, you know,
[840.19s -> 844.03s]  and and and and I was like, oh, you know, I mean,
[844.07s -> 845.75s]  they're supposed to make shorts for running.
[845.75s -> 848.35s]  These are just like basically short shorts.
[848.35s -> 850.95s]  But like what makes them like very unique
[851.87s -> 856.27s]  and and and so it was not very technical.
[856.59s -> 860.19s]  Of course, it drives fast, but this is actually at least
[860.19s -> 863.15s]  this is what you expect from from running shorts.
[863.15s -> 867.43s]  So I was like, oh, maybe maybe I could design some like better running shorts.
[868.87s -> 871.23s]  And this is how Satisfy started with the shorts.
[871.47s -> 872.99s]  I started to design shorts.
[872.99s -> 876.79s]  So I I I design.
[876.95s -> 880.11s]  I developed, I mean, before having like a team, you know,
[880.15s -> 881.99s]  I started everything by myself.
[881.99s -> 886.23s]  And what helped was my background, of course, in this industry.
[886.55s -> 890.79s]  Like I always be interested in fabrics and like technology
[890.79s -> 893.91s]  and and and design and fit, you know.
[895.63s -> 900.27s]  So so, yeah, this is how I designed the first Satisfy shorts.
[900.47s -> 903.31s]  Like the system was a double belt
[903.31s -> 907.91s]  that has like some hidden details, like a carabiner to hold your keys.
[908.87s -> 911.43s]  Like a back pocket with a membrane.
[911.43s -> 915.23s]  Then the sweat doesn't touch like your belongings in the pocket.
[915.47s -> 919.39s]  Like this phone pocket, which is like
[919.39s -> 922.99s]  on the back, on the rear of the short on the side.
[924.47s -> 927.67s]  You know, like all this like
[927.67s -> 932.11s]  pocketing things, but also spend some time developing fabrics
[932.11s -> 934.67s]  and being in France, you know, and being like
[934.79s -> 940.11s]  around like this knowledge of luxury fabrics.
[940.71s -> 943.99s]  I found this supplier in France
[944.23s -> 949.39s]  that used to be like a silk factory, so they used to make silk.
[949.67s -> 952.79s]  But silk has moved in the 50s, in the 60s.
[952.79s -> 955.11s]  So the French
[955.11s -> 960.03s]  market or the French mills that used to make silk, they moved
[962.07s -> 964.15s]  or the industry moved to Asia.
[964.15s -> 967.11s]  And you had this like amazing factories in France.
[967.27s -> 971.95s]  They had to convert their expertise from silk to
[972.79s -> 979.83s]  technical fibers, because technical fibers are as thin as like silk fibers.
[980.87s -> 983.55s]  So we have this like in France, we have this like
[983.63s -> 988.11s]  we are very lucky to have those like extremely good and premium
[989.75s -> 994.07s]  fabric mills that can make and develop like amazing fabrics.
[994.07s -> 995.23s]  Like super silky.
[995.23s -> 998.03s]  And my idea was to make basically like all the linings
[998.03s -> 1000.71s]  of our shorts to make them like super silky.
[1002.35s -> 1006.95s]  Because the the the the story behind that is like
[1007.47s -> 1012.15s]  I I experienced like getting high on my runs quite
[1013.11s -> 1016.11s]  at the early stage of being a runner.
[1016.47s -> 1020.79s]  And and I wanted to create a product
[1021.07s -> 1023.23s]  that will help you to reach that high.
[1024.79s -> 1027.55s]  And of course, like the high is not like, you know,
[1027.79s -> 1032.39s]  as different approach of the high and, you know, it may or may not exist.
[1032.43s -> 1036.27s]  But, you know, I think it exists and I experienced it.
[1036.59s -> 1038.95s]  And I truly believe that like
[1040.39s -> 1042.95s]  if you remove distraction from your life,
[1042.95s -> 1046.51s]  but also by extension also to what you wear,
[1047.31s -> 1048.71s]  you can focus.
[1048.71s -> 1052.07s]  And in our case, like if you remove distraction
[1052.31s -> 1055.31s]  from the clothes you wear on your run, you can focus on your run,
[1055.31s -> 1057.83s]  you know, and not focus on what on what you wear.
[1058.15s -> 1060.91s]  And then you can reach like the high, maybe
[1061.63s -> 1066.23s]  in a in a in a better way or in a fast in a in a faster way.
[1066.67s -> 1070.35s]  Cool. So you start with a running short product.
[1070.99s -> 1073.23s]  Did it become a brand?
[1073.23s -> 1076.67s]  And maybe how did you arrive on the name Satisfy?
[1076.71s -> 1079.79s]  What was the moment where you thought that maybe this could
[1079.79s -> 1081.71s]  turn into a self-sustaining business?
[1082.63s -> 1086.43s]  So the name came because I was listening to a band
[1086.51s -> 1089.63s]  and song was How Do You Satisfy Me?
[1089.87s -> 1093.43s]  And it was Spectrum,
[1094.11s -> 1097.63s]  Sonic Booms, like one of the guys from Space Mentory.
[1097.91s -> 1099.83s]  So some kind of like psychedelic music.
[1100.23s -> 1106.07s]  And the I mean, it became a brand
[1106.07s -> 1111.59s]  as soon as I decided like I want to help the industry.
[1113.07s -> 1117.11s]  And I am not the type of guy who does things like
[1117.87s -> 1120.31s]  like an amateur, like I want to do something.
[1120.31s -> 1123.11s]  I go like, like I dedicate my life to it, you know.
[1123.51s -> 1127.03s]  And so it has it had to become a brand like you couldn't be
[1127.03s -> 1131.59s]  just like a side project or like a hobby, you know, it has to become
[1133.71s -> 1137.15s]  you know, maybe not a business, but like something like a brand.
[1137.23s -> 1138.59s]  Yeah, something bigger.
[1138.67s -> 1143.75s]  You're now the CEO and creative director of the brand.
[1144.27s -> 1148.15s]  I'm not sure entirely how big it is now, but I'm sure those are two
[1148.59s -> 1152.67s]  highly involved roles that require different skill sets.
[1152.67s -> 1155.39s]  And I'd love to maybe have you talk about both.
[1155.39s -> 1157.43s]  And we could start with the creative side of things,
[1157.43s -> 1161.59s]  which I think is probably where you derive a lot of your joy.
[1161.63s -> 1165.19s]  Maybe talk a little bit about where you get the creative
[1165.19s -> 1167.95s]  inspiration that drives the spirit of the brand.
[1169.47s -> 1173.47s]  Well, yeah, so I am the creative director, which means that I lead
[1173.47s -> 1179.27s]  like every single, you know, like design and image.
[1179.87s -> 1185.19s]  I was also like the the the main designer,
[1185.19s -> 1189.27s]  but now I'm lucky because I have a team of people who help me.
[1189.51s -> 1195.07s]  And so now we are a team, but I started like again, like alone.
[1195.39s -> 1201.11s]  And I mean, my role is today.
[1201.11s -> 1205.95s]  Like, I think my role is to is to work for my employees, basically.
[1205.95s -> 1210.71s]  Like, it's just like I'm here to make sure that, you know,
[1211.91s -> 1214.83s]  the vision is is is consistent.
[1215.03s -> 1221.87s]  I make sure that I mean, I hope I inspire my team.
[1221.87s -> 1225.19s]  You know, I think my role is to inspire and to and to lead.
[1227.07s -> 1230.91s]  I think this is my my my main role.
[1230.91s -> 1234.87s]  And and and thankfully, I have like
[1235.43s -> 1237.95s]  I have a team because what I can say is like,
[1238.71s -> 1240.95s]  I think I'm a great leader. I'm a terrible manager.
[1240.95s -> 1244.87s]  So I'm super happy to have like a great team with me
[1244.87s -> 1250.31s]  or so to, you know, to accompany me along this this this journey.
[1250.31s -> 1252.39s]  But it's it's mostly like a teamwork.
[1252.39s -> 1254.63s]  Of course, I brought the vision.
[1254.63s -> 1257.27s]  I brought like the main the main ID.
[1257.51s -> 1262.19s]  But what what's great is that the brand is evolving, you know,
[1262.27s -> 1266.19s]  and it's evolving because of the skills of everybody, you know.
[1266.27s -> 1268.79s]  So it's not like it's not a breeze show.
[1268.79s -> 1271.91s]  You know, it's not like it's not a one man band.
[1271.91s -> 1275.03s]  You know, we are truly like I just make sure that
[1275.59s -> 1280.99s]  that my my my my my team gets my references, you know.
[1280.99s -> 1283.63s]  So that's pretty that's pretty much it.
[1283.63s -> 1285.03s]  And of course, it's a lot of work.
[1285.03s -> 1288.71s]  You know, it's like as an entrepreneur or like a creative CEO,
[1288.71s -> 1293.19s]  like whatever, like you you dedicate your life to you to this.
[1293.63s -> 1297.31s]  Yeah. Yeah. But maybe talk about the conflicting.
[1299.47s -> 1302.47s]  It feels like a left brain, right brain thing, right?
[1303.27s -> 1306.79s]  When you're the creative person who's coming up.
[1306.79s -> 1310.91s]  I'm sorry, but you're coming up with the artistic vision.
[1311.31s -> 1312.63s]  Sounds like a lot of fun.
[1312.63s -> 1317.79s]  But then when you're managing the finances and the team and hiring people,
[1318.03s -> 1323.23s]  ensuring that the culture of the business remains healthy and professional.
[1324.71s -> 1326.91s]  Do you experience friction between those two
[1328.03s -> 1330.31s]  designations, the roles?
[1330.35s -> 1331.87s]  Yeah, yes.
[1331.87s -> 1336.31s]  And no, because I am as much excited by
[1336.87s -> 1340.87s]  by the creative than by the I remember I'm a builder.
[1340.87s -> 1343.11s]  So I like also the idea of building a brand.
[1343.43s -> 1345.95s]  So I really I really like both sides.
[1346.23s -> 1348.79s]  And I think I'm also
[1351.35s -> 1354.71s]  mature enough today to,
[1355.67s -> 1358.31s]  you know, to be a bit less
[1361.31s -> 1364.39s]  I don't know how to put this, but like
[1365.63s -> 1368.03s]  I think I'm
[1368.87s -> 1371.03s]  I think I'm a better person now and I'm I'm
[1371.87s -> 1374.79s]  it's easier for me to let it go sometimes, you know.
[1376.27s -> 1378.19s]  And I think I learned this from running.
[1378.19s -> 1381.43s]  So that's great, because running like taught me a lot of things.
[1381.43s -> 1384.03s]  Like I think I became a much more better person
[1384.71s -> 1386.11s]  thanks to running.
[1386.11s -> 1388.39s]  And and and yeah.
[1388.39s -> 1390.43s]  So I think I think
[1391.63s -> 1393.03s]  I think we're doing quite well.
[1393.03s -> 1395.47s]  And I think, as you said, like this left
[1396.23s -> 1398.35s]  right brain thing.
[1398.35s -> 1400.59s]  But it's not too difficult for me, actually.
[1401.23s -> 1406.27s]  I I I prefer that that instead of being like
[1406.87s -> 1411.99s]  having like total freedom on like business or total freedom on like
[1412.91s -> 1415.95s]  on on on on design or design direction.
[1416.23s -> 1418.67s]  I like having like a tight framework.
[1418.67s -> 1421.07s]  It makes it so much easier, actually.
[1421.67s -> 1426.07s]  Yeah. So the original motivation for me
[1426.07s -> 1428.75s]  reaching out to you to have you on the podcast was an article
[1428.75s -> 1433.39s]  written in the business of fashion about trail running and its ascendancy
[1433.39s -> 1439.03s]  within the active wear category and identifying a lot of the big established
[1439.39s -> 1442.43s]  brands who are now creating product for trail running.
[1442.43s -> 1444.95s]  But they made a point to reach out to you.
[1445.27s -> 1446.11s]  And so I would.
[1446.11s -> 1448.23s]  And that was what really made me inspired.
[1448.23s -> 1450.27s]  Like, oh, I got to get Brice on the podcast.
[1450.27s -> 1454.23s]  So I'd love to hear you talk maybe a little bit about that article,
[1454.23s -> 1458.83s]  but also more generally kind of like why you started
[1458.99s -> 1462.07s]  with trail running, it seems like, especially because
[1462.71s -> 1466.55s]  there is a broader running ecosystem and a bigger market,
[1466.55s -> 1469.03s]  probably especially where you live in Paris.
[1469.31s -> 1471.63s]  It's more urban and road focused.
[1472.63s -> 1474.03s]  No, definitely.
[1474.03s -> 1475.51s]  That's a really good question.
[1475.51s -> 1479.39s]  And since day one, we always
[1481.35s -> 1486.55s]  encouraged through our products and our content to leave the city.
[1486.87s -> 1491.59s]  And we know that, like, you know, the most of the running communities,
[1491.59s -> 1494.19s]  they live in big cities like, you know, we know that like,
[1494.87s -> 1498.27s]  you know, trail running compared to road running, you know,
[1498.59s -> 1503.43s]  is like a low 10 or 15 percent of the, you know, the whole thing.
[1503.79s -> 1507.39s]  And but I think
[1508.39s -> 1512.27s]  I think there is an opportunity for me, the opportunities to inspire people.
[1512.55s -> 1515.11s]  And I live in Paris.
[1515.11s -> 1518.55s]  And yes, it's not easy to go trail running.
[1518.55s -> 1524.48s]  But I think as a brand, I mean, our goal also is to inspire people.
[1524.48s -> 1529.36s]  And and and this idea of like leaving the city
[1529.64s -> 1534.36s]  like being able like to to travel, you take the train and you do like three
[1534.36s -> 1537.64s]  or four hours by train because it's totally possible to do this.
[1537.64s -> 1541.60s]  For example, in France, you know, in Paris, you travel four hours.
[1541.60s -> 1543.08s]  Basically, like if you live in L.A.
[1543.08s -> 1546.92s]  and you take your car during rush hour, you know, you're still in L.A.
[1546.92s -> 1550.60s]  But in Paris, if you do three hours of train, you
[1551.20s -> 1556.00s]  you can go to the south of France, to the French Riviera, Riviera, you know.
[1556.20s -> 1559.00s]  And so it's not so difficult.
[1559.96s -> 1564.08s]  And we picked we didn't pick, but we like for me, since the beginning,
[1564.08s -> 1569.80s]  it was obvious that I wanted to satisfy to be a trail running brand
[1570.44s -> 1575.16s]  because. I don't know, I think it's much more like
[1577.40s -> 1581.64s]  interesting because it's again, my approach of running is like meditation
[1582.12s -> 1584.52s]  and it's not like bravado.
[1584.52s -> 1587.24s]  It's not like we like scoring, of course, like, you know, like,
[1587.24s -> 1590.56s]  I mean, you are you're an amazing athlete and you score and you,
[1590.76s -> 1594.40s]  you know, you run fast and, you know, but I for me,
[1594.44s -> 1598.48s]  because again, it's like it's it's my perception of of of running
[1598.48s -> 1602.44s]  and training training is like is a journey, you know,
[1602.44s -> 1605.84s]  and the trip is part of the journey, you know, so leaving the city,
[1606.28s -> 1609.60s]  going to like to the mountains in the south of France,
[1609.84s -> 1611.60s]  like it's part of the journey.
[1611.60s -> 1613.88s]  And this is what I'm trying to to tell.
[1613.88s -> 1617.60s]  We satisfy like to to to tell the whole journey.
[1617.60s -> 1619.20s]  You know, I think it's a beautiful.
[1619.20s -> 1621.36s]  It's a beautiful story. Yeah.
[1621.36s -> 1624.68s]  More than more than I'm pissed at work.
[1624.68s -> 1628.08s]  And I'm going to I'm going to go for a run at lunch
[1628.32s -> 1631.12s]  because I really need to, you know,
[1632.20s -> 1635.16s]  I don't know to to to.
[1635.20s -> 1636.88s]  I'm too much under pressure right now.
[1636.88s -> 1638.20s]  I need to go for a run.
[1638.20s -> 1642.52s]  I want to tell like like not a better story, but a different story.
[1642.80s -> 1643.80s]  Yeah, I love it.
[1643.80s -> 1646.44s]  So speaking of storytelling,
[1647.24s -> 1651.12s]  I see the differentiation of Satisfy moving along
[1651.24s -> 1654.76s]  two vectors, product and your marketing.
[1655.16s -> 1658.40s]  And you mentioned earlier with your denim brand
[1658.80s -> 1664.16s]  that the culture was baked into that brand and the products that you offered.
[1664.16s -> 1666.48s]  It very much is with Satisfy, too.
[1666.88s -> 1671.72s]  So as the creative director, as we start talking about marketing
[1671.72s -> 1675.96s]  and strategy more or less, what guides that tone of voice
[1675.96s -> 1678.84s]  that you use on various marketing channels?
[1678.84s -> 1682.00s]  And what is the significance of storytelling with your brand?
[1684.92s -> 1689.76s]  So our OK, our secret source, if I may say,
[1690.84s -> 1695.44s]  we always start with a story and then we develop the products around the story.
[1696.28s -> 1699.12s]  So before developing the products,
[1699.56s -> 1702.52s]  we like, OK, why are we doing this product?
[1702.52s -> 1707.48s]  You know, that always like a like a like a purpose in the in the
[1708.20s -> 1709.96s]  in our offer.
[1709.96s -> 1714.64s]  And I like, for example, to start with like the packing list.
[1714.64s -> 1718.56s]  OK, I'm going to do is OK, that's I'm going to run Coco Dona.
[1718.56s -> 1720.20s]  OK, what do I need?
[1720.20s -> 1723.52s]  You know, and then we develop the products for Coco Dona.
[1723.96s -> 1728.32s]  And this is why our content is so close to our product
[1728.32s -> 1731.24s]  and to who we are, because it's
[1732.56s -> 1734.76s]  I mean, it's authentic and genuine.
[1734.76s -> 1739.08s]  And it's all about the it's all about like the the activity.
[1739.08s -> 1740.28s]  It's all about running.
[1740.28s -> 1744.40s]  And and then what we add on top of that, it's.
[1745.40s -> 1750.84s]  It's just like, you know, colors or like dyeing techniques.
[1750.84s -> 1756.80s]  And, you know, it's just it it creates connections with people.
[1756.80s -> 1761.08s]  So I like this idea of bringing like culture
[1761.44s -> 1765.52s]  because it's an easy way to connect with community.
[1766.04s -> 1767.92s]  And it's I think that's the best way.
[1767.92s -> 1772.68s]  Like if you see someone who wears like a bandstie that you
[1772.68s -> 1775.28s]  and you like the band, you know, I mean, I don't know,
[1775.28s -> 1777.56s]  like you have a Slayer T-shirt and you see someone
[1777.56s -> 1781.60s]  with like like a carcass T-shirt and you're in the middle of nowhere.
[1781.76s -> 1785.08s]  You guys will be like, you know, you are connected, you know.
[1785.76s -> 1789.08s]  And and and so it's the same with running.
[1789.08s -> 1789.92s]  I think it's the same.
[1789.92s -> 1793.76s]  And I think we have created this like this cult, you know,
[1793.76s -> 1796.72s]  like if you see someone with like a satisfy cap, you know,
[1796.88s -> 1801.00s]  and you wear also like a satisfy, like if you know, you know that thing.
[1801.36s -> 1804.56s]  I think this is what we manage to do with our product.
[1804.84s -> 1807.24s]  Yes. And I'm very proud of this.
[1807.56s -> 1810.24s]  Yeah, I'd love to talk about this a little bit more
[1810.24s -> 1814.76s]  because in that business of fashion article, they use a quote from you
[1814.76s -> 1817.32s]  where you say trail cultures like skateboarding,
[1817.32s -> 1819.36s]  even when you're not out practicing the sport,
[1819.36s -> 1822.12s]  people still want to display that they are part of the community
[1822.36s -> 1824.96s]  by wearing trail shoes or the technical clothing.
[1824.96s -> 1827.96s]  And this is what you're getting at is it's sort of like a signaling thing
[1828.28s -> 1830.80s]  that you both belong to the same community.
[1830.80s -> 1834.76s]  You reference the running cult member tagline,
[1834.76s -> 1839.12s]  which you use across product and on marketing materials.
[1839.16s -> 1841.16s]  Where did that come from?
[1841.16s -> 1845.88s]  And maybe what has it meant for building the brand and its reputation in the space?
[1847.12s -> 1849.88s]  Well, it comes from like
[1849.88s -> 1852.88s]  I don't really remember, but for me, it was so important to use.
[1852.88s -> 1855.16s]  I mean, the world, the world,
[1855.16s -> 1857.32s]  the world, the cult is culture.
[1857.32s -> 1860.88s]  Basically, it's the same, you know, same, same world.
[1860.92s -> 1864.80s]  So I think it was like
[1864.80s -> 1866.80s]  a way to gather, like
[1869.20s -> 1871.88s]  our fans, you know, like the thing that we have fans
[1871.88s -> 1875.28s]  that not customers and not clients, you know, we like a band,
[1875.28s -> 1877.80s]  you know, we have fans and I like this idea of having like
[1879.88s -> 1884.32s]  you know, I there's something that I really like about satisfying.
[1884.80s -> 1888.64s]  I think what we do is and I always,
[1888.96s -> 1891.52s]  you know, I always say the same things, but
[1892.44s -> 1895.40s]  and I always compare what we do is like music.
[1895.68s -> 1899.80s]  And if you go to a concert, you know, you want to.
[1899.80s -> 1902.64s]  So you the music is the experience
[1903.00s -> 1906.48s]  and and you want to buy like maybe after the concert,
[1906.48s -> 1909.32s]  you want to buy like a cap or a T like a merch, you know,
[1910.40s -> 1911.72s]  you go to the merch table
[1911.72s -> 1915.04s]  and you want to buy like a souvenir from the concert.
[1915.64s -> 1918.48s]  And I like to think that, you know, satisfying the same, like,
[1918.48s -> 1920.32s]  you know, satisfy running dot com.
[1920.32s -> 1921.48s]  That's a merch table.
[1921.48s -> 1924.72s]  But the but the merch is like super technical, super premium.
[1925.12s -> 1928.12s]  And the experience is running is trail running, you know.
[1928.44s -> 1933.16s]  So we basically, you know, through our content,
[1933.16s -> 1939.08s]  you know, we we enhance the the the experience
[1939.28s -> 1943.12s]  and the product we are selling is just a merch, you know,
[1943.64s -> 1947.36s]  except again, that the merch is like, you know, made in Portugal,
[1947.36s -> 1949.20s]  super sustainable.
[1949.20s -> 1952.12s]  You know, we develop everything here in Paris.
[1952.12s -> 1957.20s]  Like, it's like we're not just not just sure.
[1958.60s -> 1962.92s]  Sorry, what I said, it's not just a printed T-shirt of player or
[1962.92s -> 1965.56s]  I mean, you're wearing a CrossFit steals a dash T-shirt.
[1967.36s -> 1968.52s]  I love this, Bruce.
[1968.52s -> 1970.28s]  This is so fun to chat about with you,
[1970.28s -> 1974.84s]  and it makes me want to ask you about possessed the magazine to talk
[1974.84s -> 1977.08s]  about content a little bit.
[1977.08s -> 1980.20s]  You mentioned earlier, again, that you I think we're doing
[1980.20s -> 1982.64s]  vinyl records for your denim brand.
[1982.64s -> 1986.28s]  And now you have what looks like a very cool magazine
[1986.28s -> 1988.80s]  product that's attached to satisfy.
[1989.48s -> 1993.80s]  Talk about where that came from and how it buttresses
[1993.80s -> 1995.52s]  the rest of the marketing efforts.
[1995.52s -> 1997.48s]  What value does possessed bring to the brand?
[1998.36s -> 2001.52s]  So I have to give the credit to my friend, Ian.
[2001.52s -> 2004.84s]  And he told me once like you need like
[2005.84s -> 2011.92s]  you need a tone, but it's not the tone doesn't come from the brand.
[2011.92s -> 2016.36s]  The tone comes from like a person and it was like, oh, you need
[2016.36s -> 2019.92s]  like a chief editor, you need like a magazine, you know,
[2019.92s -> 2021.80s]  and I thought it was a genius idea.
[2023.28s -> 2025.72s]  And I was like, oh, that's a great idea.
[2025.72s -> 2029.40s]  Let's let's try, you know, and together, like we thought
[2029.80s -> 2035.28s]  about like the magazine and and what we like about magazines.
[2035.28s -> 2038.04s]  And he has also like a background in skateboarding and music.
[2038.04s -> 2043.00s]  So we share like the same, you know, same same background.
[2043.40s -> 2047.92s]  And and yeah, you know, what we like in in in in Trusher
[2047.92s -> 2052.08s]  magazine was like, you know, like the the scene report,
[2052.08s -> 2057.24s]  you know, we like the the the music, like reviews and stuff like this.
[2057.56s -> 2061.04s]  So, yeah, so we just did we just did like,
[2061.68s -> 2065.88s]  you know, we basically did like a skateboard magazine for runners,
[2065.88s -> 2069.68s]  you know, and and so possessed.
[2070.84s -> 2072.84s]  Had several
[2074.00s -> 2075.12s]  incarnations.
[2075.12s -> 2078.40s]  And today we are.
[2078.40s -> 2081.80s]  So it started now two years ago, I think.
[2081.80s -> 2086.20s]  And we, you know, we we made some like report
[2086.20s -> 2090.04s]  like we reviewed like a code and we
[2090.76s -> 2092.92s]  we interviewed like a bunch of musicians.
[2092.92s -> 2098.36s]  We interviewed like Anton Kripke, you know, was not like a satisfied athlete,
[2098.36s -> 2099.60s]  you know, and that's great.
[2099.60s -> 2101.48s]  Like when you have someone like Anton
[2103.16s -> 2106.68s]  was not like a satisfied athlete that who accept to do this.
[2106.68s -> 2108.52s]  It's like, yeah, because we talk about running.
[2108.52s -> 2109.44s]  We talk about culture.
[2109.44s -> 2114.64s]  You know, we're not talking about like fashion or products like a brand.
[2114.76s -> 2117.68s]  You know, it's a different conversation.
[2119.48s -> 2123.08s]  So I think it's something we can be proud of, like having built this
[2123.08s -> 2126.48s]  like a magazine, but we're going to
[2127.88s -> 2131.48s]  spend more time on the magazine like this year, actually.
[2131.80s -> 2135.76s]  And hopefully we will be able to to print it.
[2137.36s -> 2140.64s]  Maybe not like every month, but maybe it becomes like
[2141.36s -> 2144.40s]  like, you know, like every end of the year.
[2144.56s -> 2147.04s]  You can get like a physical version of the magazine.
[2147.52s -> 2150.80s]  I like this idea of like, you know, like in the 60s, all the bands
[2150.80s -> 2153.88s]  they would put like every month, like a new record, you know,
[2153.88s -> 2155.60s]  like a new like a single.
[2155.60s -> 2158.12s]  And at the end of the year, like the Christmas album
[2158.44s -> 2161.84s]  was gathering all the songs together.
[2162.08s -> 2162.80s]  It's a bit the same.
[2162.80s -> 2164.96s]  You know, we could do like like a monthly
[2166.12s -> 2167.96s]  online process issue.
[2167.96s -> 2170.92s]  And at the end of the year, you know, we printed something like this.
[2171.00s -> 2172.76s]  Yeah. So we just hired.
[2172.80s -> 2175.52s]  We just hired actually like a new
[2175.52s -> 2180.52s]  editor in chief and someone who is formerly from like
[2181.28s -> 2183.84s]  a surf and skateboard media.
[2184.20s -> 2188.52s]  So and who actually stopped skateboarding a few years ago
[2188.52s -> 2190.88s]  and like is really into running now.
[2190.88s -> 2193.72s]  So that's, you know, it's everything we like, you know, skateboarding.
[2193.92s -> 2195.76s]  It's perfect.
[2195.76s -> 2199.24s]  And surf and skate and running.
[2199.52s -> 2200.88s]  Yeah, it's great.
[2200.88s -> 2205.52s]  And I'm really happy that you brought up the Anton interview specifically,
[2205.52s -> 2209.80s]  because as somebody who's just been flipping through the digital
[2210.08s -> 2213.20s]  version of the magazine online, I read through
[2213.64s -> 2217.92s]  that interview now a couple of times and somebody who has consumed
[2217.92s -> 2220.88s]  basically every interview that Anton has ever done.
[2221.96s -> 2222.96s]  One of my favorites.
[2222.96s -> 2225.08s]  And it's fantastically well done.
[2225.08s -> 2228.52s]  And I think, as you said, Anton, of course, being a long time
[2228.52s -> 2232.28s]  athlete for La Sportiva, he's not affiliated with Satisfy in any way.
[2233.00s -> 2237.64s]  The interview very much captures, I think, the spirit of Satisfy
[2237.64s -> 2241.52s]  and the spirit of Anton and the spirit of the sport all at the same time.
[2241.68s -> 2244.40s]  It makes you want to ask about the athlete strategy, too.
[2244.44s -> 2248.24s]  Like I told you, I talked to Logan Williams, who's one of the satisfy
[2248.24s -> 2251.40s]  athletes and I think is also sort of an employee for the brand.
[2251.40s -> 2253.24s]  Also, yes. Yes.
[2253.24s -> 2257.40s]  He was saying, you know, obviously it is a story driven brand, right?
[2257.40s -> 2261.36s]  And that trickles down to the athlete team where storytelling
[2261.56s -> 2265.16s]  is the emphasis or the priority, not necessarily performance.
[2265.16s -> 2266.88s]  Can you talk about that?
[2266.88s -> 2267.60s]  Yeah, sure.
[2267.60s -> 2270.68s]  I mean, the first athlete we signed
[2271.04s -> 2274.68s]  was Michael Rusty that you may know.
[2274.96s -> 2278.64s]  And I don't know.
[2278.64s -> 2284.56s]  Like I was following my because I liked him as a human being,
[2284.56s -> 2286.84s]  you know, is, you know, is is this like,
[2289.08s -> 2293.56s]  you know, incredible runner, but also like he's
[2294.52s -> 2298.56s]  he's his lifestyle, like who he is, like it's super interesting.
[2298.92s -> 2302.16s]  And we connected through music like, you know,
[2303.72s -> 2307.52s]  it's funny because I think like a lot of connections
[2308.20s -> 2312.32s]  Satisfy is making is like Anton Krupik, you know,
[2312.32s -> 2315.44s]  like he's a he's a black Sabbath fan, you know, like I think we talked
[2315.84s -> 2319.24s]  about music and, you know, and and this is how we connect,
[2319.24s -> 2322.20s]  you know, our skateboard music or, you know, whatever.
[2322.32s -> 2325.72s]  But never really like because if you're a pro runner,
[2325.72s -> 2328.20s]  like you don't want to talk about running, you want to talk about something else.
[2328.20s -> 2332.52s]  You know, like if you want to, I don't know, if you if you want to interview
[2332.52s -> 2335.92s]  like, I don't know, like a musician you love, you know,
[2336.20s -> 2338.40s]  you don't want to be brewing and speak about music.
[2338.48s -> 2341.80s]  You want to talk about something else, you know, that there's more chance
[2341.80s -> 2344.44s]  that he or she
[2344.44s -> 2347.44s]  and get a conversation with you if you're not talking about music, you know.
[2349.32s -> 2350.52s]  And I think
[2353.44s -> 2355.48s]  this connection with Michael was like
[2356.72s -> 2359.48s]  so I reached out to him
[2359.48s -> 2363.36s]  and and because again, I liked him as a as a runner,
[2363.36s -> 2364.92s]  but also as a human being.
[2364.92s -> 2369.44s]  And yeah, you see, I mean, it was really like super easy.
[2369.44s -> 2373.96s]  Like he he said yes right away because because of who we are, you know.
[2374.16s -> 2379.44s]  And I think he he had some bad experience with like big brands, you know.
[2379.64s -> 2384.76s]  And I don't expect from the athletes, you know, to post on social or to like,
[2384.76s -> 2388.04s]  you know, I mean, you do it if you if you if it's your thing.
[2388.04s -> 2389.16s]  Yeah, do it, you know.
[2389.16s -> 2393.80s]  But we're not sponsoring athletes to get like
[2395.32s -> 2396.80s]  Instagram posts, you know.
[2396.80s -> 2401.12s]  What we expect is to grow as a brand, to make better products.
[2402.20s -> 2406.40s]  Like when we have Mike coming to Paris and, you know, we just we developed
[2406.40s -> 2411.16s]  like a few months ago, like a new a new band, like a new
[2412.48s -> 2416.52s]  like a like a hydration kind of hydration pack belt.
[2416.52s -> 2417.64s]  Yeah, we see.
[2417.64s -> 2418.64s]  And it was amazing.
[2418.64s -> 2421.12s]  We also developed like a new three layer jacket
[2423.96s -> 2424.92s]  with him.
[2424.92s -> 2427.08s]  And that's just amazing for me.
[2427.08s -> 2428.24s]  That's that's a value.
[2428.24s -> 2434.12s]  And in exchange, we we you know, we we help him through his
[2435.52s -> 2438.40s]  he's his career.
[2438.60s -> 2441.60s]  But Mike is a very,
[2441.60s -> 2444.32s]  you know, is not like the expected athlete.
[2444.32s -> 2446.56s]  Like we're not expecting Mike to win races.
[2446.56s -> 2451.36s]  The thing is like you won Coco Dona like a month after we signed him,
[2451.36s -> 2454.12s]  you know, so like, OK, oh, that's great.
[2454.44s -> 2456.92s]  He can also win races and stuff.
[2456.92s -> 2459.20s]  That's great. But it's not what we expect.
[2459.20s -> 2461.28s]  You know, and I think
[2463.08s -> 2466.72s]  I think it's much more interesting to create stories with Mike.
[2466.72s -> 2472.08s]  Like Mike has an idea, for example, Mike wants to climb some volcanoes
[2472.08s -> 2473.84s]  like in Mexico.
[2473.84s -> 2475.28s]  Basically came with this idea.
[2475.28s -> 2478.00s]  He wants to buy like vintage motorcycles
[2479.80s -> 2482.60s]  and in the U.S. cross the border,
[2483.60s -> 2487.60s]  go to like Mexico and to climb those like volcanoes.
[2487.60s -> 2490.76s]  And, you know, and that's a great idea.
[2490.76s -> 2492.32s]  You know, so you have the idea.
[2492.32s -> 2494.72s]  We have the packing list for the expedition.
[2494.92s -> 2497.96s]  And our role is to make the products like, you know, to
[2498.36s -> 2503.20s]  to help him to accomplish his his his journey.
[2504.00s -> 2505.32s]  So I like this.
[2505.32s -> 2509.32s]  You know, we will never be able to compete with like, you know,
[2510.64s -> 2511.36s]  we're not Nike.
[2511.36s -> 2514.12s]  You know, we can't be like, you know, a million of dollars
[2514.12s -> 2517.64s]  to get an athlete, you know, and we don't want to do it anyway.
[2517.92s -> 2521.84s]  So so that's our approach.
[2522.04s -> 2524.64s]  So we signed Michael, we signed Logan,
[2526.28s -> 2528.16s]  Tien and Jacob.
[2528.16s -> 2531.24s]  Amazing. All like amazing trail runners.
[2531.28s -> 2535.36s]  Yeah. And all great human beings with good reputations
[2535.36s -> 2538.64s]  who are interesting, you know, exactly.
[2539.28s -> 2543.52s]  In the spirit of talking about how you're not Nike,
[2543.52s -> 2548.12s]  it makes me want to kind of talk more about defining who you are
[2548.12s -> 2549.56s]  and what you want to stand for.
[2549.56s -> 2556.12s]  You mentioned before how the product is like super premium merch. Right.
[2556.64s -> 2559.20s]  And it's not it's not about not being Nike.
[2559.20s -> 2561.60s]  When I say we're not Nike, I was talking about like we don't have
[2561.88s -> 2565.68s]  we don't have they're like we don't have like the same
[2566.12s -> 2567.48s]  amount of money to spend.
[2567.48s -> 2568.32s]  I know what you meant.
[2568.32s -> 2569.04s]  I know what you meant.
[2569.04s -> 2574.00s]  But like the where where I was going is, you know, it's a premium product.
[2574.00s -> 2578.48s]  And that sometimes comes with people
[2578.48s -> 2580.64s]  will criticize a brand like yours.
[2580.64s -> 2585.08s]  I'm affiliated a partner with Speedland, the footwear brand,
[2585.08s -> 2589.84s]  which is unapologetically also a super premium product.
[2590.28s -> 2593.44s]  And some people, you know, sort of can be critical about it.
[2593.44s -> 2596.80s]  But you're sort of speaking to a different market,
[2596.80s -> 2598.48s]  a different audience.
[2598.48s -> 2602.24s]  And I wondered if there's anything that you want to say about that,
[2602.24s -> 2607.12s]  about like, you know, what goes into that positioning
[2607.12s -> 2611.52s]  and what type of person are you trying to speak to?
[2611.52s -> 2614.76s]  Or more generally, just sort of like
[2614.76s -> 2618.32s]  having a point of view, you know, and the value of that.
[2619.00s -> 2621.92s]  Yeah. So I mean, different things like.
[2624.20s -> 2626.12s]  So we are a product brand, of course,
[2626.12s -> 2630.28s]  like we are very, you know, we have this this
[2631.12s -> 2635.16s]  like this content and, you know, like a brand arm, which is very strong.
[2635.56s -> 2638.28s]  But we are equally strong on product.
[2638.28s -> 2640.76s]  Like we develop everything in house in Paris.
[2640.76s -> 2644.20s]  We have like pattern maker, designer, product developers.
[2645.40s -> 2646.60s]  Everything is developed here.
[2646.60s -> 2648.96s]  We don't do like a finished garment.
[2648.96s -> 2651.72s]  We don't send like a take back to the factory
[2651.96s -> 2653.80s]  expecting that they will do it.
[2653.80s -> 2655.40s]  No, we buy the fabric.
[2655.40s -> 2657.72s]  We buy the accessories, the things.
[2657.96s -> 2660.32s]  We make the first prototype in house.
[2661.80s -> 2664.16s]  A fit model comes.
[2664.28s -> 2666.72s]  We try. We make the modification.
[2667.32s -> 2670.28s]  We do P1 like another prototype.
[2670.28s -> 2675.08s]  Like it's it takes like up to a year to develop a product.
[2675.16s -> 2679.00s]  So our approach is like very product oriented
[2679.16s -> 2683.40s]  and very like actually like a like a maison de couture would do, you know.
[2683.40s -> 2687.36s]  So this costs money.
[2687.64s -> 2690.84s]  But I think the the the
[2691.64s -> 2695.36s]  the problem is like the problem is not that that is very short.
[2695.36s -> 2696.60s]  Our two hundred dollars.
[2696.60s -> 2700.64s]  The problem is that short some shorts are like forty dollars.
[2701.04s -> 2704.36s]  How the hell can you make some short at forty dollars?
[2704.56s -> 2706.28s]  Like there's there's a catch.
[2706.28s -> 2707.84s]  There's a trick for sure.
[2707.84s -> 2712.12s]  Yes. If you want to to buy like like good fabrics,
[2712.12s -> 2715.12s]  if you want to make your shorts
[2716.08s -> 2721.24s]  with a factory that respects like a human conditions,
[2721.40s -> 2726.40s]  if you want to to minimize your your carbon footprint,
[2726.60s -> 2729.16s]  you can do short at forty dollars.
[2729.16s -> 2730.84s]  You can do T-shirts for twenty.
[2730.84s -> 2732.40s]  That's that's a problem.
[2732.40s -> 2734.28s]  The problem is not that we are expensive.
[2734.28s -> 2738.56s]  The problem is that the 10 major active wear brands
[2739.00s -> 2745.76s]  are not expensive because they have decided to be mass market.
[2745.76s -> 2747.24s]  And there's no secret.
[2747.24s -> 2751.48s]  If you if you go mass market, well, you you you I mean,
[2752.44s -> 2757.04s]  your your fabric can cost more than like five dollars or three dollars.
[2757.36s -> 2759.72s]  Our fabrics, they cost twenty dollars, you know.
[2760.04s -> 2762.68s]  So the product is different.
[2762.68s -> 2768.08s]  So our prices are expensive because the fabric is different.
[2768.16s -> 2771.04s]  Our process are different.
[2771.04s -> 2776.68s]  Like where we produce is we produce in Europe, like not not not in Asia.
[2776.68s -> 2778.96s]  And I think in Asia, they have some great factories.
[2778.96s -> 2782.32s]  You know, it's not about which really like the the location.
[2782.32s -> 2786.52s]  But we buy fabrics mostly in Europe and we produce in Europe
[2786.80s -> 2791.44s]  to reduce the, you know, the the the carbon footprint,
[2791.44s -> 2793.88s]  like all the travel and all of the shipping and stuff.
[2794.32s -> 2798.64s]  So I think like being sustainable,
[2798.88s -> 2801.84s]  cost money, being a premium cost money.
[2802.08s -> 2805.76s]  But also once the runners
[2806.72s -> 2810.92s]  have our shorts in their hands, like you can tell the difference.
[2810.92s -> 2813.52s]  And I think the big challenge for us is being like
[2813.52s -> 2816.68s]  mostly like an online brand that we don't have like retail.
[2816.88s -> 2821.16s]  We have a bit of wholesale, but like we are mostly a D2C brand.
[2821.48s -> 2826.36s]  The challenge for us is to explain this through like,
[2826.92s -> 2829.16s]  you know, social and through our website.
[2829.16s -> 2832.12s]  But once you get the product in hands, you know, it's like,
[2832.36s -> 2833.48s]  you know, it's like a speedlamp.
[2833.48s -> 2838.32s]  Like I I don't have a pair, but I I I I have a friend
[2838.32s -> 2841.16s]  who owns a pair of speedlamps and, you know, and you understand,
[2841.16s -> 2844.08s]  you know, like you like, OK, you know, you have the Boas.
[2844.08s -> 2845.12s]  So it's more expensive.
[2845.12s -> 2847.84s]  You have like the removable like a plate.
[2847.84s -> 2850.36s]  And, you know, you can tell.
[2850.40s -> 2853.16s]  And also just the quantities, like you're not producing like
[2853.80s -> 2857.64s]  10,000 units, you're you're producing like 500 units, maybe, you know.
[2857.88s -> 2861.88s]  So it's it's a it's a different product, a different brand.
[2862.16s -> 2865.24s]  Yes. And yeah, thank you for that.
[2865.28s -> 2867.52s]  No, I think that was brilliant.
[2868.36s -> 2871.80s]  Of not education, but like need to explain.
[2871.80s -> 2874.20s]  And I think some people get it.
[2874.20s -> 2875.84s]  Some people don't. And it's fine.
[2875.84s -> 2878.00s]  You know, it's totally fine.
[2878.00s -> 2881.36s]  Yeah, well, I think you did a fantastic job explaining it.
[2881.36s -> 2884.08s]  So I think we got to start kind of winding down now.
[2884.08s -> 2886.60s]  We have some time left, but I'd love to start
[2886.60s -> 2889.60s]  sort of looking to the future for the brand.
[2890.04s -> 2894.04s]  You and I, again, spoke last week and maybe before we get to some
[2894.04s -> 2898.32s]  of the future stuff, we can sort of talk a little bit about what you've learned.
[2898.32s -> 2901.96s]  I'd love to hear about maybe any big challenges that you face
[2901.96s -> 2906.44s]  so far as a new upcoming startup brand.
[2906.76s -> 2910.52s]  And, you know, you as a founder and as a leader of that brand,
[2910.52s -> 2914.52s]  how you've navigated that any special things that you've learned
[2914.52s -> 2918.08s]  that help you overcome those challenges.
[2918.08s -> 2921.44s]  Yeah, I mean, I've learned a lot through this journey.
[2921.44s -> 2925.04s]  And the main thing I've learned is actually
[2926.12s -> 2931.88s]  and it's through running like you like as a human being,
[2932.08s -> 2934.36s]  we can reinvent ourselves.
[2934.36s -> 2935.36s]  And this is amazing.
[2935.36s -> 2939.44s]  You know, we just have to like our brain and we can become someone else.
[2939.56s -> 2941.00s]  You know, and this is great.
[2941.00s -> 2944.64s]  Like I never I never thought I would be a runner.
[2944.64s -> 2946.72s]  I never thought I would start like a running brand.
[2946.72s -> 2951.60s]  You know, it's just that this capacity as human being
[2951.60s -> 2953.96s]  we have to reinvent ourselves is amazing.
[2954.28s -> 2957.08s]  And so this is something I've learned through this journey.
[2957.40s -> 2959.32s]  And I've also
[2961.52s -> 2963.96s]  yeah, you know, you have like great moments.
[2964.96s -> 2968.60s]  I mean, as an entrepreneur, like amazing moments, somehow more like
[2969.88s -> 2972.68s]  difficult. But again, it's it's it's
[2974.28s -> 2975.92s]  it's it's it's teamwork.
[2975.92s -> 2979.04s]  And what is amazing, which is great, is like to build a team, you know,
[2979.64s -> 2982.20s]  and and and to see like
[2983.32s -> 2986.36s]  how this system can work.
[2986.52s -> 2989.84s]  And you have to be agile
[2989.84s -> 2993.72s]  because what you have in mind is not necessarily going to happen.
[2994.52s -> 2997.52s]  Because we're talking here about like, you know, human beings, you know,
[2997.52s -> 3001.48s]  so it's not like, you know, you can't do like a PowerPoint
[3001.48s -> 3004.44s]  and expect that everything will be like exactly
[3005.80s -> 3007.04s]  how you want it to be.
[3007.04s -> 3010.96s]  And what I say to my team all the time is like we have to embrace
[3010.96s -> 3015.68s]  like the like the accidents sometimes like one of the like
[3015.84s -> 3019.04s]  like an example, you know, we we have this T-shirt called
[3019.04s -> 3023.28s]  must take it's basically like a cotton T-shirt with holes, you know.
[3023.52s -> 3027.04s]  And I I've designed this T-shirt like two days
[3027.84s -> 3031.24s]  before showing the collection for the first time.
[3031.52s -> 3033.16s]  And it becomes a bestseller.
[3033.16s -> 3038.24s]  And, you know, so sometimes I'm really pushing my team
[3038.40s -> 3042.48s]  to to embrace or so, like being more like a spontaneous and
[3043.96s -> 3046.20s]  and and and being more like
[3047.48s -> 3050.92s]  yeah, just to to to embrace everything, you know, and take take
[3050.92s -> 3054.20s]  like there's always opportunities
[3054.92s -> 3058.04s]  within the like the hard times, you know.
[3058.04s -> 3061.88s]  So what's instead of like focusing on what's like very difficult and hard,
[3062.08s -> 3064.56s]  just trying to find where is the opportunity.
[3065.00s -> 3067.84s]  And by the way, I don't know if I answered your question.
[3067.84s -> 3071.68s]  I felt that I I I've been a bit
[3073.04s -> 3076.08s]  I don't I don't think I phrased it very well either.
[3076.08s -> 3077.24s]  But I think you did.
[3077.24s -> 3080.48s]  I mean, we were I was I was more or less getting at the challenges
[3080.48s -> 3083.04s]  of entrepreneurship, which are infinite.
[3083.04s -> 3085.64s]  And as somebody who has been older.
[3085.64s -> 3088.96s]  But yeah, but the main, the main challenge is, I mean, you
[3089.60s -> 3091.72s]  you know, you want to grow, you know, you want to grow.
[3091.72s -> 3096.44s]  And and and the pace, you know, the pace of like growth is very
[3098.80s -> 3101.48s]  you know, you need you need to create products.
[3101.64s -> 3104.44s]  You have to make sure that like
[3104.44s -> 3110.04s]  you you make like enough money to handle like production and try to do everything.
[3110.04s -> 3113.68s]  So you have like the math, you have like
[3114.88s -> 3116.16s]  the human part.
[3116.16s -> 3119.44s]  And then you have also like the the the creativity
[3120.28s -> 3121.56s]  and you have the dream, you know.
[3121.56s -> 3123.88s]  So we make sure that we follow our dream.
[3124.12s -> 3127.44s]  And you have to make sure that all the rest is aligned with your dream.
[3127.44s -> 3129.60s]  And this is where it's really challenging, you know,
[3131.52s -> 3135.16s]  the balance between the dreams, the communities, the product,
[3135.72s -> 3138.72s]  the finance and the people.
[3138.72s -> 3140.44s]  Yeah. And you're the team. Yeah.
[3140.44s -> 3142.16s]  I love it. Thanks, Bruce.
[3142.16s -> 3145.84s]  So looking ahead, what are your goals for the future of Satisfy
[3145.84s -> 3149.36s]  running in terms of growth and in terms of impact?
[3149.36s -> 3152.28s]  You and I again spoke last week and you said that you're working on some
[3152.64s -> 3154.56s]  women's products, so maybe you could tie that in.
[3154.56s -> 3156.96s]  Yeah. So two things.
[3156.96s -> 3161.76s]  Actually, we are launching on the 420.
[3162.36s -> 3166.08s]  We are launching a collection called Stoner, of course.
[3166.28s -> 3169.76s]  And it's a kind of being it's a it's a climbing collection.
[3170.08s -> 3171.76s]  And it's a capsule.
[3171.76s -> 3174.32s]  It's like, yeah, I think,
[3175.48s -> 3178.60s]  you know, we will be always about like trail running.
[3178.76s -> 3181.92s]  But part of the journey for me, you have like hiking,
[3181.92s -> 3186.00s]  trekking, like adventure, you know, and you have also like a climbing.
[3186.32s -> 3191.40s]  So I'm very happy to launch our first like equipment for climbing.
[3192.36s -> 3196.28s]  And we so that's like short term.
[3196.52s -> 3201.64s]  We have like a few cool collabs this year
[3204.56s -> 3209.28s]  with like some, you know, like shoe collabs, like I wear I wear
[3210.56s -> 3212.64s]  backpacks, like really cool stuff.
[3212.64s -> 3217.40s]  I mean, our our take on collabs is like we are super happy to do collabs
[3217.76s -> 3222.44s]  as long as we are not able to make the product ourselves.
[3222.44s -> 3226.12s]  You know, like so I think that's a good way to do collabs
[3226.12s -> 3229.32s]  because you don't want to overproduce.
[3229.32s -> 3231.20s]  I think we really want to stick to
[3232.60s -> 3236.52s]  to make things like right and to make things only if they are needed.
[3236.52s -> 3241.20s]  You know, and and so we have these like amazing collabs this year.
[3241.40s -> 3245.36s]  And then, yeah, for next year,
[3245.36s -> 3247.88s]  we are working on the first woman collection.
[3249.36s -> 3253.04s]  Finally, like we always been like,
[3254.36s -> 3256.24s]  I mean, our product are designed for
[3257.80s -> 3262.16s]  for for for men or for people who identified as as men.
[3262.44s -> 3267.72s]  And we we but we never advertised it
[3267.72s -> 3272.40s]  because I truly believe in like, you know, being also like gender fluid.
[3272.40s -> 3276.80s]  You know, we have a lot of like women who were like satisfied.
[3278.24s -> 3282.56s]  But I also understand like some some like body type need,
[3282.56s -> 3284.48s]  like some very specific products.
[3284.48s -> 3289.72s]  So we're going to launch this this this collection like next year.
[3289.72s -> 3292.48s]  So I'm super excited about about it. Yeah.
[3293.36s -> 3295.60s]  And then and then we'll see, you know, we'll see.
[3297.72s -> 3300.04s]  I mean, of course, we have like a few ideas
[3300.16s -> 3302.52s]  and a few projects that I can't share right now.
[3302.92s -> 3305.72s]  But the brand is growing for sure.
[3305.72s -> 3308.80s]  And and and yeah, I mean,
[3309.72s -> 3312.16s]  our goal is to be, you know, like
[3313.16s -> 3316.72s]  I like the idea of being like the trail running brand of a generation.
[3317.12s -> 3322.16s]  You know, and and and I think,
[3322.76s -> 3326.84s]  you know, like brands are some brands are aging and they are no longer relevant.
[3327.12s -> 3331.64s]  And I think it's very important to to to be
[3331.92s -> 3334.92s]  to be relevant, to be aligned with a community,
[3335.24s -> 3338.28s]  to be aligned with the world we're living in.
[3338.60s -> 3340.88s]  And this is what we try to do. We we satisfy.
[3342.28s -> 3343.92s]  Yeah. Right.
[3343.92s -> 3346.16s]  Well, by the time this podcast comes out,
[3346.16s -> 3348.08s]  the stoner collection will be live.
[3348.08s -> 3351.88s]  So the listening audience, I can tell you like,
[3352.20s -> 3356.08s]  I can tell you like the name and you like also that drops on the 420.
[3356.08s -> 3358.16s]  I'm 420. Yeah, it's perfect.
[3359.68s -> 3361.68s]  I love it. Awesome.
[3361.68s -> 3365.20s]  Bruce, man, I could talk to you for another hour,
[3365.20s -> 3367.44s]  but I know we need to start winding down now.
[3367.44s -> 3370.60s]  So I'd love to close with a couple of philosophical questions
[3370.60s -> 3373.32s]  that I've been asking all of our guests recently.
[3373.76s -> 3378.28s]  The first is who is one person that you admire inside or outside of sports,
[3378.28s -> 3381.12s]  living or dead, and why is it that you admire that person?
[3382.36s -> 3384.16s]  Oh, wow. OK.
[3384.32s -> 3390.48s]  Uh, so it's going to be difficult for me to like to name one person and because.
[3391.68s -> 3395.84s]  I mean, I admire a lot of people like, you know, friends, family,
[3395.84s -> 3397.88s]  like, you know, like artists.
[3397.88s -> 3401.68s]  And when I was when I was a teenager, like I used to be like fan,
[3401.68s -> 3405.44s]  you know, of like a musician, I was a big fan of Gunn and Roses, you know.
[3405.68s -> 3412.60s]  And and but I admire them because of what they were doing,
[3412.60s -> 3414.96s]  not because of who they were, you know.
[3414.96s -> 3418.96s]  So when you when you when you age and when you, you know,
[3418.96s -> 3420.96s]  you grew up a bit, you understand like, you know,
[3420.96s -> 3426.20s]  you admire people for like who they are and not for what they are doing.
[3426.48s -> 3430.24s]  And it means that you need like to know the people, you know.
[3430.40s -> 3435.84s]  So I can tell like, you know, I admire like some friends and some like family.
[3436.28s -> 3440.60s]  And and and I think it's I mean, the great thing about like
[3440.60s -> 3441.64s]  admiring people.
[3441.64s -> 3444.64s]  And I think it's not everybody that can admire someone.
[3444.92s -> 3447.64s]  I think it's something you.
[3448.44s -> 3451.88s]  It comes at some point in your life that you are OK to admire people
[3451.88s -> 3456.00s]  because you you basically abandon narcissism, you know,
[3456.00s -> 3459.64s]  you you you shift the focus away from from yourself.
[3459.84s -> 3463.84s]  And this is why this is what inspire you.
[3464.12s -> 3470.28s]  And I mean, I always be admiring like I have some friends like this.
[3470.60s -> 3474.64s]  That are very like positive, like that, like the PMA,
[3474.64s -> 3476.84s]  you know, the positive mental attitude.
[3476.84s -> 3480.96s]  And and and often I'm like, OK,
[3481.56s -> 3484.20s]  what what he or she will do.
[3484.48s -> 3485.72s]  So what? Yeah.
[3485.72s -> 3488.36s]  Instead of me, like sometimes I'm in some like situation.
[3488.36s -> 3490.36s]  I don't know what to do or I don't know how to react.
[3490.68s -> 3493.68s]  And I'm like, OK, what he or what she will do, you know.
[3493.92s -> 3497.88s]  And so I admire people, some some friends actually
[3498.04s -> 3500.68s]  that are very like positive, much more than I am.
[3500.68s -> 3504.36s]  You know, I think I need I'm learning a lot from them.
[3504.60s -> 3507.92s]  I think I could be a better person being more like
[3511.24s -> 3515.72s]  yeah, just just just positive and not to to.
[3516.36s -> 3519.04s]  I don't know. Sometimes it's my group.
[3519.04s -> 3521.84s]  I mean, sometimes I feel I can be a bit of like
[3522.48s -> 3525.32s]  a bit like that negative person, but like
[3525.32s -> 3527.92s]  I don't know, like
[3529.64s -> 3531.92s]  I don't know, like I could do better.
[3531.92s -> 3533.28s]  You know, this is why you have friends.
[3533.28s -> 3535.40s]  You know, you you pick, you know.
[3537.08s -> 3541.56s]  Yeah. So so I would say like some very, very, very, very close friends
[3541.56s -> 3545.16s]  that I really like the company because they are just
[3545.88s -> 3548.72s]  I like the way like they see like things.
[3548.72s -> 3552.76s]  They make it so much more like they make things like simple and
[3552.76s -> 3555.40s]  and and also like
[3558.56s -> 3561.92s]  yeah, they inspire you, you know, and this is super important.
[3562.40s -> 3565.16s]  Fantastic. Final question for you here, Bruce.
[3565.16s -> 3569.12s]  What is one truth that you've learned about yourself
[3569.12s -> 3572.20s]  or about life in general through your experience with running,
[3572.20s -> 3574.24s]  which I know you discovered late in life?
[3574.24s -> 3577.56s]  What is running taught you? Yeah.
[3577.56s -> 3580.88s]  Well, I mentioned it earlier.
[3581.00s -> 3585.36s]  Like that thing that you do have to be the same
[3585.36s -> 3588.44s]  the same person you your entire life, like
[3589.44s -> 3594.20s]  like again, I never thought that I would run
[3594.20s -> 3598.76s]  and I would like register like for like, you know, 50K race.
[3598.76s -> 3602.28s]  You know, like if you would have told me that, like, you know,
[3602.80s -> 3605.48s]  I don't know, like 10 years ago, I would be like, OK, what the fuck?
[3605.48s -> 3608.56s]  You know, like like I wouldn't believe you.
[3608.88s -> 3612.20s]  Um, but but
[3612.20s -> 3615.56s]  unlike, you know, like animal animals,
[3615.56s -> 3619.56s]  you know, like pets, like they can't reinvent themselves.
[3619.56s -> 3622.52s]  You know, like Doug will be always a dog, you know, and
[3623.40s -> 3628.56s]  but we can we we can become basically like whatever we want to become.
[3628.56s -> 3631.56s]  You know, like, you know, if you want to be like a runner,
[3631.56s -> 3634.04s]  OK, start to run, you know, and you will become a runner, you know.
[3634.28s -> 3636.40s]  And I like I like I like this.
[3636.40s -> 3638.72s]  So I think it requires also like
[3639.52s -> 3642.04s]  accepting that you can hike your brain.
[3642.24s -> 3644.96s]  I like this idea of like
[3644.96s -> 3647.20s]  I don't have to be the same person my entire life
[3647.20s -> 3649.32s]  and I can hike my brain to become
[3651.04s -> 3656.96s]  to become or to reach that stage where I will shine.
[3656.96s -> 3658.92s]  You know, like this idea also like of
[3661.76s -> 3665.28s]  you know, becoming what also you are supposed to do.
[3665.44s -> 3669.04s]  And you become this person and then you're free to to change again.
[3669.04s -> 3670.56s]  You know, that's that's that's great.
[3670.56s -> 3674.68s]  I like and this is what I think this is what running taught me.
[3675.16s -> 3676.48s]  Amazing.
[3676.48s -> 3680.80s]  Well, Brice, it's been fantastic to get you get to know you here briefly.
[3680.80s -> 3684.40s]  I'm a big admirer of what you're building there at Satisfy.
[3684.40s -> 3686.32s]  Good luck with what you do.
[3686.32s -> 3688.96s]  And thank you for coming on the podcast.
[3688.96s -> 3690.60s]  Thank you so much for having me.
[3690.60s -> 3694.28s]  And yeah, it was a great moment.
[3694.80s -> 3697.08s]  It's seven p.m. now in Paris.
[3697.36s -> 3702.44s]  And I'm actually going now for a run with one of my friends
[3702.44s -> 3703.84s]  that I really admire.
[3703.84s -> 3705.36s]  So it would be nice.
[3705.36s -> 3707.84s]  I will I will share with him also
[3709.00s -> 3712.44s]  our moment like what we talked about, and I'm sure he will appreciate.
