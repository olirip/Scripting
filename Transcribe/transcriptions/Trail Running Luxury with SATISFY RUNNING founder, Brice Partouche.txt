[0.91s -> 7.39s]  Alright, it's season two on the DFL before DNF podcast.
[7.39s -> 13.89s]  I am super excited today to be talking with Brice Partouche.
[13.89s -> 17.33s]  He is the founder of Satisfy.
[17.33s -> 24.07s]  But as I've followed him and what he's up to, I think it's just interesting to...
[24.07s -> 27.05s]  This will make sense to Brice as I start to say it, I'm going to say a little
[27.05s -> 28.95s]  bit about who I am.
[28.95s -> 30.77s]  And it just is, it's quite interesting.
[30.77s -> 36.61s]  I grew up a skateboarding punk rock kid, though I was in West Texas, who ended up
[36.61s -> 38.61s]  trying to become a doctor.
[38.61s -> 43.17s]  I went pre-med and I wanted to become a doctor.
[43.17s -> 48.97s]  So I was touring in punk bands around America, tried to become a doctor, and then got
[48.97s -> 51.57s]  this sort of itch to play more music.
[51.57s -> 52.97s]  So I was playing more music.
[52.97s -> 57.69s]  And then I got into entrepreneurship and started building all sorts of different
[57.69s -> 58.69s]  companies.
[58.69s -> 62.53s]  And for the most part, my life was in food and beverage, building open seven
[62.53s -> 67.69s]  cafes, seven coffee shops in Utah, and a couple bars, a couple restaurants, was
[67.69s -> 72.17s]  very much a food, like food and beverage entrepreneur, and then did a
[72.17s -> 73.17s]  handful of other things.
[73.17s -> 76.53s]  But really, my passion and love in life has always been in running.
[76.53s -> 79.17s]  And so then I started a running related company.
[79.17s -> 81.89s]  And from the best I can tell, Brice, isn't that similar?
[81.89s -> 83.49s]  Is that similar to you?
[83.49s -> 87.65s]  You were a punk rock kid, skateboarding, you wanted to be a doctor at one
[87.65s -> 89.97s]  point. How am I doing on your story?
[89.97s -> 90.97s]  Am I close?
[90.97s -> 92.25s]  That's crazy.
[92.25s -> 94.89s]  I didn't know about your background.
[94.89s -> 102.89s]  That's crazy because, yeah, I grew up playing in punk rock bands and trying
[102.89s -> 105.69s]  to tour in Europe.
[105.69s -> 115.85s]  And I was also, yeah, my dream as a kid was to become like a heart surgeon.
[115.85s -> 117.25s]  Mine was to be a brain surgeon.
[117.25s -> 118.25s]  And it makes no sense.
[118.25s -> 121.37s]  Other than I hear that surgeons generally are a little bit more
[121.37s -> 125.09s]  entrepreneurial than say someone like a physician who's not a surgeon.
[125.09s -> 127.61s]  But it's just a funny connection.
[127.61s -> 130.45s]  Yeah, that's very funny.
[130.45s -> 132.85s]  But yeah, of course, I failed.
[132.85s -> 135.77s]  I failed my medical school.
[135.77s -> 137.01s]  It's not that I failed.
[137.01s -> 143.29s]  I stopped because the person you want to be when you're 10 or 11 is not
[143.29s -> 145.45s]  the same as a teenager.
[145.45s -> 152.81s]  I discovered punk rock and skateboarding and you become someone else.
[152.81s -> 157.81s]  But for some reason, somewhere in your mind, you're like, oh, I'm going
[157.81s -> 161.05s]  to be a doctor and you continue in that direction.
[161.05s -> 165.21s]  But you're not the same person.
[165.21s -> 170.85s]  So yeah, then I started this.
[171.05s -> 180.85s]  At the time, I had a few experiences with entrepreneur ventures.
[180.85s -> 185.61s]  And I did a few or a couple of skateboard brands for my friends.
[185.61s -> 190.37s]  I was like 15 and 16, printing ScreenStars t-shirts.
[190.37s -> 195.05s]  And you do your little brand for your friends.
[195.09s -> 203.81s]  And then later on, I created this brand called April 77.
[203.81s -> 207.01s]  It was like a jeans company, like a jeans brand.
[207.01s -> 212.01s]  And I was obsessed with the Ramones and the punk rock again.
[212.01s -> 214.93s]  So I was making basically skinny jeans.
[214.93s -> 223.05s]  But the brand became quite popular and quite big, actually.
[223.09s -> 232.93s]  And until 2000, during almost 18 years, I've been doing this brand.
[232.93s -> 240.89s]  But then I grew up in the mountains in Grenoble.
[240.89s -> 241.97s]  Oh, really?
[241.97s -> 242.65s]  Yeah.
[242.65s -> 250.81s]  So a city in the southeast of France surrounded by mountains, 20 minutes,
[250.81s -> 253.53s]  30 minutes away from ski resorts.
[253.53s -> 258.09s]  So I grew up snowboarding and before skiing.
[258.09s -> 263.57s]  So outdoor lifestyle has always been around me.
[263.57s -> 268.01s]  But I never be a climber or a trail runner.
[268.01s -> 272.05s]  I was not interested in physical activities.
[272.05s -> 275.81s]  Skateboarding and snowboarding were not really physical activities.
[275.81s -> 277.97s]  Yeah, you don't think of it that way.
[277.97s -> 278.97s]  Exactly.
[278.97s -> 286.37s]  It was more like a way to move in the city or like a trip with your friends.
[289.77s -> 299.61s]  But then, late in my life, I'm 47 now and I started to run about 13 years ago.
[299.61s -> 303.45s]  So I was 34 or something.
[303.45s -> 307.81s]  And I started to run quite late in my life.
[307.81s -> 314.69s]  And yeah, but I became quickly super obsessed with running.
[314.69s -> 318.85s]  And that's a life change.
[318.85s -> 322.93s]  I mean, when you start to run, I'm the only one who says that.
[322.93s -> 326.49s]  And I want to sound like, I don't know.
[326.49s -> 331.53s]  But yeah, it really changed my life.
[331.53s -> 341.61s]  And I think this power we have as human beings, we can become whatever we want to be.
[341.61s -> 343.13s]  That's pretty much amazing.
[343.13s -> 350.81s]  Like this capacity we have to hack our brain to become someone else.
[350.81s -> 351.73s]  That's quite amazing.
[351.73s -> 355.01s]  And this is what happens with running.
[355.01s -> 357.77s]  So I became obsessed with running.
[357.77s -> 369.49s]  And coming from skateboarding, I was pretty a bit lost when it comes to running culture.
[369.49s -> 373.85s]  I'm not saying that there was no culture into running.
[373.85s -> 378.49s]  But the culture was, I mean, they didn't talk to me.
[379.45s -> 390.77s]  You had five big mass market brands that share the whole market.
[390.77s -> 393.81s]  And it's all about performance.
[393.81s -> 397.81s]  And when you grew up skateboarding, you want more than that.
[397.81s -> 403.41s]  You want more than just polyester products.
[403.41s -> 405.29s]  You want culture.
[405.29s -> 406.05s]  You want music.
[406.05s -> 411.77s]  You want like a trip with your friends.
[411.77s -> 414.49s]  So my idea was like, oh, wow, I mean, I love running.
[414.49s -> 419.33s]  But I really hate everything around running.
[419.33s -> 420.33s]  It's not that I hate it.
[420.33s -> 421.17s]  It's a bit strong.
[421.17s -> 425.61s]  But it's mostly that I couldn't connect.
[425.61s -> 427.73s]  That's going to be my word.
[427.73s -> 432.57s]  A lot of running culture is disconnected from the actual reality of what running is.
[432.57s -> 433.97s]  Exactly.
[434.01s -> 438.61s]  There was no cool magazine or no music.
[438.61s -> 441.73s]  If you're a skateboarder, you grew up with hip hop or punk rock.
[441.73s -> 443.85s]  That's pretty clear.
[443.85s -> 447.89s]  With running, it's like whatever.
[447.89s -> 451.61s]  And it's like this stupid music they play at the start of the race.
[451.61s -> 456.97s]  So it's just like, I don't know, it was not me.
[456.97s -> 461.25s]  So I was like, OK, I'm going to make a skateboard brand for runners.
[461.73s -> 465.45s]  It was my first thought.
[465.45s -> 470.85s]  And of course, with my background in the fashion industry,
[470.85s -> 477.85s]  I wanted to make a premium brand, a brand with amazing fabrics,
[477.85s -> 488.93s]  a sustainable brand, a brand about the product will be as performance,
[488.93s -> 494.21s]  as much performance as I could bring, also cultural elements.
[494.21s -> 498.13s]  I like to add cultural value to the products.
[498.13s -> 506.73s]  And cultural value could be some references to, for example, tie-dye.
[506.73s -> 509.01s]  It's culture.
[509.01s -> 513.01s]  Or this t-shirt I'm wearing right now with the holes.
[513.45s -> 519.29s]  The vintage distressed t-shirt with the pants, tee, and stuff like this.
[519.29s -> 525.81s]  When I was a punk rock kid, we would do studded belts.
[525.81s -> 527.69s]  We'd make our own studded belts.
[527.69s -> 530.81s]  And then the holes that would wear in it look like the holes that you do.
[530.81s -> 533.29s]  It's like from skateboarding, and then you fall.
[533.29s -> 537.29s]  And then your shirt scrapes along the concrete underneath your studs.
[537.29s -> 538.77s]  And you're just ripping your clothes.
[538.77s -> 540.61s]  That's what that made me think of.
[540.65s -> 542.77s]  Exactly.
[542.77s -> 548.45s]  I totally remember this era of skateboarding with studded belts.
[557.33s -> 564.57s]  It was important to me to bring these cultural elements to the product.
[564.61s -> 572.57s]  I like this analogy with a mixer, like a table, like a music,
[572.57s -> 576.41s]  how do you call this, like a mix table,
[576.41s -> 586.85s]  where you can push up the volume.
[586.85s -> 591.89s]  Let's say you have the button of performance
[591.89s -> 599.49s]  and the button of culture, and you push.
[599.49s -> 604.37s]  I don't like to say style, because it's not style, it's more like culture.
[604.37s -> 609.29s]  And you push those two levels as far as possible
[609.29s -> 617.25s]  without having the speakers blowing up or buzzing.
[617.29s -> 623.93s]  So it's always like my work as a designer is always to find the right balance
[623.93s -> 628.53s]  between having a very performance product,
[628.53s -> 631.77s]  but also you need to connect with the product.
[631.77s -> 644.69s]  And some people will connect with the color or with the print or the fabric.
[644.69s -> 647.01s]  I like this idea a lot.
[647.01s -> 651.05s]  Yeah, I think one of the things that's interesting about you just hearing you talk
[651.05s -> 657.01s]  and what makes you unique is that you know the product really well
[657.01s -> 662.77s]  and you know the branding really well, like you know how to create lifestyle around.
[662.77s -> 665.89s]  But especially unique is your ability,
[665.89s -> 669.33s]  and it sounds like you did this with your jeans company,
[669.33s -> 673.65s]  like supply chain within clothing is not easy.
[673.65s -> 674.73s]  That's a skill in and of itself.
[674.73s -> 677.13s]  So if you're obsessed with the product, the quality of it,
[677.13s -> 681.17s]  and then also you know how to get it made at scale.
[681.17s -> 685.89s]  And at the same time, you can identify someone like Michael Verstieg
[685.89s -> 689.41s]  as like a perfect alignment for what you're trying to build and an embodiment of it.
[689.41s -> 692.17s]  And then you're bringing these other great athletes that reflect it.
[692.17s -> 695.45s]  I think that's something that's really interesting and unique about you
[695.45s -> 698.21s]  just from this short conversation that we've had.
[698.21s -> 699.73s]  Do you resonate with that?
[699.73s -> 701.73s]  Do you agree with that?
[701.73s -> 704.45s]  Well, no. Well, yeah, thank you first.
[704.45s -> 707.85s]  But yes, this is my job.
[707.85s -> 713.09s]  I don't necessarily think like this.
[713.09s -> 720.29s]  Like, you know, for me, it's very hard to look at myself and to analyze what I'm doing.
[720.29s -> 727.57s]  But yes, I think a brand is not only the product, it's like a journey.
[727.57s -> 730.81s]  It's like how you connect along the journey,
[730.81s -> 734.49s]  how you connect with a community, with your dream.
[734.49s -> 741.49s]  Like, you know, like a brand is basically like a dream, a product and a community, you know.
[741.49s -> 747.49s]  And of course, there is also like all the processes and like the team you're building.
[747.49s -> 752.69s]  And, you know, but yeah, it's a journey and it's hard.
[752.69s -> 759.09s]  Like, you know, the success to, you know, if you want to have a brand, you need to work hard.
[759.13s -> 764.41s]  It's like, it's not easy, because if you have everything, if you have the product,
[764.41s -> 770.29s]  the community, the dream, it doesn't mean that it's going to work.
[770.29s -> 772.57s]  Like, you know, and you need to work hard.
[772.57s -> 780.09s]  And even with this, like maybe it will work, you know, it's very difficult.
[780.09s -> 784.69s]  Yeah. So help me, like, if we back up a little bit to the start of it,
[784.69s -> 786.89s]  help me get the details right on this.
[786.89s -> 791.69s]  I read somewhere that you started to really have the dream for this company.
[791.69s -> 794.01s]  And I hate that I can't remember the name of the park.
[794.01s -> 800.53s]  There's a beautiful park that's in Paris, that's in the north, northeast.
[800.53s -> 802.69s]  It's a nice complex.
[802.69s -> 804.13s]  Bois de Vincennes.
[804.13s -> 806.29s]  Yes.
[806.29s -> 811.61s]  And I think it's from like, you know, an American perspective, getting to go see that park.
[811.61s -> 815.77s]  We stumbled upon it. We don't hear about it much, but I think it's the most beautiful park.
[815.77s -> 825.85s]  And so am I correct in my learning that there's some part of Satisfy that started in that park with you or the idea came to you there?
[825.85s -> 831.13s]  Yeah, exactly. Because I was running, you know, almost every day in the morning there.
[831.13s -> 840.17s]  And first of all, like when I started to run, I couldn't understand why people would run with like in running clubs.
[840.93s -> 845.09s]  Like the last thing I want to do is to run with 20 people I don't know.
[845.09s -> 853.17s]  Like for me, running was the only moment of the day when I'm alone.
[853.17s -> 856.49s]  And it's a sacred moment.
[856.49s -> 861.45s]  And you want to keep it for yourself because the rest of the day, you know, you have to give to people.
[861.45s -> 866.69s]  It's like, you know, emails, you know, meetings, calls, you know.
[866.69s -> 879.33s]  And so the idea of Satisfy came during one of these runs early morning.
[879.33s -> 893.49s]  And, you know, like this, this like feeling like the runners high or the flow or whatever, like this moment when your brain is floating.
[893.49s -> 899.01s]  And I've been quite lucky because I experienced this moment a few times.
[899.01s -> 908.49s]  And I'm like, this is amazing, you know, when you just, you know, when you do your first 20K and you're like, it's just amazing.
[908.49s -> 910.33s]  It's like it's crazy.
[910.33s -> 917.45s]  And just like this, like euphoria and this amazing feeling.
[917.45s -> 925.37s]  And when you get to this moment, you basically you I mean, what I liked with this,
[925.37s -> 931.93s]  I mean, the idea of Satisfy came also with this moment when you reach the high,
[931.93s -> 939.17s]  because the idea was to make the clothes that will help you to reach that high.
[939.17s -> 945.57s]  So basically, it means that, OK, you shouldn't you shouldn't you shouldn't, you know,
[945.57s -> 953.49s]  notice that you are wearing clothes, you know, because what you want is to you don't want any distraction.
[953.49s -> 957.53s]  You just want to focus on your run and on your high.
[957.53s -> 964.41s]  So the first like the main idea was to create the lightest product ever.
[964.49s -> 970.41s]  You know, no seams, no, no, no shafing, like, you know, like a whole system of like
[970.41s -> 976.01s]  pocketing to carry like, you know, your keys, you know, you don't want your keys to jingle together, for example.
[976.01s -> 978.61s]  You know, absolutely the classic stuff.
[978.61s -> 985.09s]  But that for me, they were they were not really well done by other brands.
[985.09s -> 992.17s]  But also, and again, like, you know, you can run with like whatever, of course, you know.
[992.17s -> 999.37s]  But this element of culture, you know, like was terribly missing.
[999.37s -> 1007.53s]  And I feel that if you if you feel like if you if you feel that you look great, you will perform better.
[1007.53s -> 1011.37s]  I really believe in this.
[1011.37s -> 1022.01s]  And yeah, so, you know, and I think I like to say that our approach of performance is very romantic.
[1022.01s -> 1025.49s]  Yeah, it's, you know.
[1025.49s -> 1032.69s]  And so that was the main idea of Satisfy, like a romantic approach of of performance,
[1032.69s -> 1040.81s]  premium products and, you know, rebranding the running culture.
[1040.81s -> 1047.37s]  Yeah, what I think is beautiful about what you've done and, you know, I've spent a lot of time in France
[1047.37s -> 1050.61s]  and I've mentioned on this podcast that my family is moving to France.
[1050.61s -> 1057.25s]  One of the things I love about what you've done is that you've embraced France into your branding.
[1057.25s -> 1061.61s]  And what what what makes that especially unique is people have done that, maybe not in ultra running.
[1061.61s -> 1062.97s]  You're probably the first to do that.
[1062.97s -> 1066.45s]  But you also have this interesting tie.
[1066.45s -> 1073.69s]  And tell me if I'm if I'm wording it in a way that is good or if you would reword it to the the myth of the American West.
[1073.69s -> 1077.45s]  I see there's a connection to like desert vibes.
[1077.45s -> 1085.65s]  If nothing else, it's that your colors work, your materials, your colors work so well on the backdrop of the American West desert.
[1085.65s -> 1091.89s]  And maybe that's just because that's where Michael Versteeg is or Sarah, you know, anybody that you sponsor there, they're there.
[1091.89s -> 1101.25s]  But you that romanticism, that relentless, uncompromising pursuit of quality,
[1101.25s -> 1110.73s]  sacrificing revenue or sacrificing profit for quality, sacrificing profit for the spirit of what you're building.
[1110.73s -> 1113.85s]  I feel like that is what makes you unique.
[1113.85s -> 1117.57s]  How close is everything that I just said to what is in your mind?
[1117.57s -> 1129.01s]  It's thinking. No, it's really well spotted, actually, because I grew up like watching cowboy movies,
[1129.01s -> 1131.77s]  like western movies with my dad.
[1131.77s -> 1141.49s]  But my favorite movies were the European movies about Americana.
[1141.49s -> 1158.37s]  And I always always found the the European approach of like Americana much more like poetic and romantic than when when when Hollywood was doing
[1158.37s -> 1165.77s]  like cowboy movies, you know, like I prefer Sergio Leone over John Ford, basically.
[1165.77s -> 1179.33s]  And I grew up with like this this this idea of like like like American, like a like a romantic romanticized, romanticized,
[1179.33s -> 1185.65s]  romanticized, romanticized idea of Americana.
[1185.65s -> 1197.45s]  And and this is very also very close to, you know, one of my favorite era of like moviemakers are like the late 60s and,
[1197.45s -> 1200.93s]  you know, like the the Nouvelle Vague.
[1200.93s -> 1210.73s]  And I really, you know, I'm a big fan of this, like, you know, like Easy Rider movie or like the Monty Hellman movies,
[1210.77s -> 1212.33s]  like, you know, Tulane, Blacktop.
[1212.33s -> 1220.85s]  And, you know, the way you tell Americana through like movies and it's very contemplative and romantic.
[1220.85s -> 1227.05s]  And so this this this artistic direction is really what I like.
[1227.05s -> 1238.69s]  And I feel that Satisfied could be like the missing link between, you know, you like Europe and the U.S.
[1238.69s -> 1245.93s]  Not only also, I mean, in terms of like like visual, yes, but also in terms of product.
[1245.93s -> 1252.29s]  I think that what we did is we got inspired by the trail running scene in the U.S.,
[1252.29s -> 1261.53s]  which is what I'm talking about products right now, which is kind of like kind of like, you know, this this idea of the of the desert.
[1261.97s -> 1270.49s]  You know, like, like, you know, you wear whatever, you know, like, you know, the microversic basically, like, you know, the dirt bag, yes.
[1270.49s -> 1283.45s]  And the over performance, you know, like Salomon, like all white Lycra, Kilian Jornet, 2004, you know.
[1283.45s -> 1289.25s]  I've joked about Kilian Jornet's all white, whatever he wore, being so bold.
[1289.85s -> 1293.49s]  He brings that to Western states and America in like 2009.
[1293.49s -> 1295.61s]  And we didn't know what to do with that.
[1295.61s -> 1303.65s]  Yeah. So and and and I think, you know, in terms of product, we, you know, we we are in between.
[1303.65s -> 1308.29s]  Like, you know, we play with we play with those like references.
[1308.29s -> 1316.69s]  So I think our approach is like Americana through the lens of Europe or France.
[1316.69s -> 1318.89s]  You know, we can say France.
[1318.89s -> 1330.01s]  And this is this is my my my way of when I design, when I when I create, it's my my way of not working.
[1330.01s -> 1332.05s]  But this is who I am.
[1332.05s -> 1338.01s]  Yeah. And you know, some of the critiques that we hear about satisfy is the price point.
[1338.01s -> 1342.29s]  But before I before I get your take on that, my observation on that.
[1342.29s -> 1348.45s]  All right. So you're you're in the third arrondissement or are you in there?
[1348.45s -> 1354.29s]  Oh, no, we are in the 11th, which is very close.
[1354.29s -> 1361.93s]  Yes. Yes. So if you walk out, by the way, what's Bouillon Republic?
[1361.93s -> 1366.01s]  Bouillon, yeah. I never been.
[1366.01s -> 1369.17s]  It's very it's a very affordable, really great food.
[1369.17s -> 1374.21s]  But they you know, it's not French because they're getting you in and out real quick anyway.
[1374.21s -> 1380.25s]  So if you walk out your door, one of the ways that I tried to characterize it to my friends in America,
[1380.25s -> 1385.01s]  what I love about France and why I want to move there and just be influenced by it for a year.
[1385.01s -> 1392.77s]  I never it's hard to it's hard to put into words, but in France, even the trash cans are well designed.
[1392.77s -> 1395.17s]  So when you walk out on the street, you're probably used to it.
[1395.17s -> 1399.13s]  But maybe, you know, I'm talking about, you know, those like thin wire trash cans that come around
[1399.13s -> 1402.25s]  and then there's like a green trash bag in the middle and it's so worn down.
[1402.25s -> 1406.29s]  What France is good at, because you're the most visited country in the world,
[1406.29s -> 1413.65s]  is that your trash cans have to be able to withstand 90 million, whatever visitors a year.
[1413.65s -> 1418.41s]  But because the French culture also is that things would be beautiful.
[1418.41s -> 1423.17s]  So you French culture has to withstand an insane amount of wear and tear.
[1423.17s -> 1430.69s]  And as it wears as it wears and tears, it becomes more beautiful.
[1430.69s -> 1435.29s]  And I don't even like the bridges, the paint, the way the paint wears in Paris.
[1435.29s -> 1439.01s]  It's I'm being a little bit romantic, but at the same time, it's so practical
[1439.01s -> 1441.77s]  because it has to withstand an insane amount of wear and tear.
[1441.77s -> 1445.49s]  And I think that that's why one of the reasons satisfied.
[1445.49s -> 1451.77s]  That's what that's some of the Frenchness of satisfy that you're bringing to America is also like this.
[1451.77s -> 1453.89s]  Well, if you're going to get something that's going to be resilient
[1453.89s -> 1460.01s]  and it's going to withstand 250 miles, it can't be cheap.
[1460.01s -> 1464.01s]  Like if it's going to be if it's going to be able to do the job that you need it to do,
[1464.01s -> 1467.33s]  can't be cheap, especially if you're also trying to take care of your supply chain
[1467.33s -> 1469.89s]  and have good people make it.
[1469.89s -> 1472.61s]  This is my observation and it's a bit romantic.
[1472.61s -> 1474.17s]  But what do you think?
[1474.17s -> 1480.05s]  No, I mean, you know, Paris, like we live in a museum, you know.
[1480.05s -> 1482.25s]  Yeah, you do.
[1482.25s -> 1488.29s]  It's and it's funny because me, like I'm so happy when I go to the US
[1488.29s -> 1491.05s]  because I can just tie out of the museum.
[1491.05s -> 1494.05s]  Yeah, I believe it.
[1494.05s -> 1498.25s]  Because you'll come to the desert of Arizona where you can also then spread out
[1498.25s -> 1501.69s]  and it's actually quiet and you can feel the sun on your body.
[1501.69s -> 1506.73s]  Exactly. Like I love Arizona, I love California, I love Utah.
[1506.73s -> 1512.69s]  But yeah, I mean, Paris is a good it's a good I like to come back to Paris.
[1512.69s -> 1517.17s]  I like to leave Paris, but I like also to come back to Paris.
[1517.17s -> 1520.85s]  So I can I can call Paris home.
[1520.85s -> 1526.49s]  But yeah, to your point, I mean,
[1526.49s -> 1530.69s]  Paris, yeah, we we invented, you know, like luxury here.
[1530.69s -> 1534.65s]  Like, you know, we have like LVMH, Louis Vuitton, Céline, you know,
[1534.65s -> 1538.89s]  Balenciaga, like, you know, that's that's part of the that's part of the culture.
[1538.89s -> 1540.33s]  Part of the culture.
[1540.33s -> 1544.89s]  So if you do if you do a closing, if you have like a brand,
[1544.89s -> 1549.85s]  you are surrounded, especially in Paris, you are surrounded by talents
[1549.85s -> 1557.21s]  and by, you know, by by people who knows about it, like
[1557.21s -> 1560.81s]  what is to to, you know,
[1560.81s -> 1565.21s]  who knows about like luxury and what it means.
[1565.21s -> 1570.61s]  And even with like, you know, the whole like
[1570.61s -> 1574.65s]  industry, like the luxury industry, everything happens in Paris,
[1574.65s -> 1578.61s]  in Milan also sometimes, but like it's Paris.
[1578.61s -> 1585.37s]  And so it's created a culture of luxury here in France is culture.
[1585.37s -> 1590.73s]  In the US, there is no there is no like luxury group.
[1590.73s -> 1593.73s]  I mean, there are some brands like, you know, premium brands.
[1593.73s -> 1595.81s]  And but it's not luxury.
[1595.81s -> 1598.13s]  It's it's a bit it's a bit different.
[1598.13s -> 1605.53s]  So what may be, you know, seen as luxury in the US, for example,
[1605.53s -> 1610.65s]  like I've heard people saying that LVMH is a luxury brand.
[1610.65s -> 1615.41s]  But for us, LVMH is not a luxury brand, you know, for us,
[1615.41s -> 1619.89s]  for us, luxury is like, you know, Louis Vuitton and Céline.
[1619.89s -> 1627.01s]  So so so, you know, I think the perception also as a French person
[1627.01s -> 1631.57s]  of what is luxury, like we said about very, very high.
[1631.57s -> 1639.13s]  And and I think that is why is I mean,
[1639.13s -> 1642.61s]  if you compare to the mass market brands,
[1642.61s -> 1645.65s]  I don't know if you are luxury, but yes, we are more expensive.
[1645.65s -> 1648.25s]  But just because we are not mass market.
[1648.25s -> 1653.53s]  Like, yeah, the thing is, the thing is, since like like this industry
[1653.53s -> 1659.53s]  has been ruled by mass mass market brands for like, you know, 40 years.
[1659.53s -> 1666.45s]  So we are basically the industry, the outdoors industry is.
[1666.45s -> 1674.73s]  Is it's like if it was the 1985 for fashion.
[1674.73s -> 1677.81s]  So it may, you know, so
[1677.81s -> 1681.01s]  before I before the 80s, like there was no like luxury,
[1681.01s -> 1684.37s]  you know, there was no Gucci, there was no Dolce Gabbana, you know.
[1684.37s -> 1690.17s]  So I think Satisfy just like, you know, is paving the way
[1690.17s -> 1695.73s]  for like a different segment within the industry.
[1695.73s -> 1700.41s]  But of course, you can be luxury just claiming you are luxury.
[1700.41s -> 1701.65s]  You know, that's right.
[1701.65s -> 1704.21s]  And we are we're not saying we are luxury.
[1704.21s -> 1707.33s]  We people say that our price are more expensive.
[1707.33s -> 1714.61s]  Yes, but also, I mean, two things are price are more expensive
[1714.61s -> 1716.69s]  because the products are different.
[1716.69s -> 1717.77s]  You know, you can't compare.
[1717.77s -> 1719.09s]  It's like, I don't know.
[1719.09s -> 1724.41s]  It's like if you compare like, you know, two different brands of cars,
[1724.41s -> 1727.89s]  you know, like, you know, I don't know if you compare like,
[1727.89s -> 1729.37s]  I don't even know.
[1729.37s -> 1731.37s]  I can't even name a car brand.
[1731.37s -> 1733.73s]  Like a Ford to a Porsche.
[1733.73s -> 1735.65s]  Exactly. You know, like it's the same.
[1735.69s -> 1738.85s]  The Porsche is more expensive because it's not the same as a Ford,
[1738.85s -> 1741.45s]  you know, and it's fine, you know.
[1741.45s -> 1744.53s]  So same with same with brands.
[1744.53s -> 1747.89s]  But also, I think.
[1747.89s -> 1749.45s]  I think it's.
[1749.45s -> 1750.61s]  I don't know.
[1750.61s -> 1754.45s]  I don't want to, you know, I don't want to to shock or but like I
[1754.45s -> 1758.81s]  it's not it's not normal to buy shorts for 50 dollars.
[1758.81s -> 1763.05s]  If you buy your shorts for 50 dollars, it means that your shorts
[1763.73s -> 1768.57s]  have been made with like a terrible fabric in terrible conditions.
[1768.57s -> 1770.41s]  It's just it's just pure math.
[1770.41s -> 1774.53s]  Like today, the cost of fabric is very expensive.
[1774.53s -> 1778.49s]  The cost of like, you know, the making is very expensive.
[1778.49s -> 1779.73s]  Also, it's satisfied.
[1779.73s -> 1781.97s]  We develop everything in house.
[1781.97s -> 1785.93s]  So we have cost to cover because we have like pattern makers.
[1785.93s -> 1788.17s]  We have like a prototypist.
[1788.17s -> 1789.49s]  We have, of course, designers.
[1789.49s -> 1791.57s]  We have product developers, pattern makers.
[1791.57s -> 1792.57s]  I said it.
[1792.89s -> 1795.01s]  And are they are they all in Paris?
[1795.01s -> 1799.37s]  Yes, in Paris, in this office where I'm where I am right now.
[1799.37s -> 1802.37s]  From just from a business standpoint, by way of observation,
[1802.37s -> 1807.97s]  that is that is quite a triumph and also clearly a commitment
[1807.97s -> 1810.57s]  to not just quality, but being.
[1813.45s -> 1817.33s]  Because France has requirements on you as an employer
[1817.33s -> 1820.29s]  and you have to really you're really you're making Americans,
[1820.29s -> 1822.45s]  we don't understand the commitment that you're making
[1822.45s -> 1824.69s]  when you hire somebody.
[1824.69s -> 1828.37s]  So, yeah, because people in the US can can get fired and,
[1828.37s -> 1829.77s]  you know, you can get fired.
[1829.77s -> 1834.53s]  French, you can't get to stay on the payroll for 12 months
[1834.53s -> 1837.33s]  and not do something if some I mean, it's hard to explain.
[1837.33s -> 1839.53s]  And I don't want to I'm not talking disparagingly.
[1839.53s -> 1842.37s]  What I'm trying to say is you've really committed
[1843.41s -> 1845.65s]  because you could have you could have you could have offshored
[1845.65s -> 1848.41s]  your production and it would have been a little bit easier
[1848.41s -> 1849.41s]  for you to make changes.
[1849.45s -> 1851.65s]  And so you're really having to be extremely intentional.
[1852.65s -> 1855.77s]  And there's a practical element that things are more expensive
[1855.77s -> 1857.97s]  because the way that you've committed to the humans
[1857.97s -> 1859.77s]  that are also making your product.
[1860.97s -> 1863.49s]  Yes, but also because I'm obsessed with product
[1863.49s -> 1866.93s]  and I want to control everything, every every stage.
[1867.57s -> 1868.49s]  Yeah, exactly.
[1869.73s -> 1872.09s]  I mean, for me, that's just one way to do this,
[1872.93s -> 1874.97s]  to do this job, you know, like if you want to do
[1874.97s -> 1879.09s]  like the best the best technical products, you have to
[1879.61s -> 1883.81s]  follow every stage of the making from, you know,
[1883.81s -> 1888.25s]  sketching to prototyping to prototype zero
[1888.25s -> 1890.37s]  and to the final products.
[1890.61s -> 1893.93s]  And a lot of a lot of other brands are actually just,
[1893.93s -> 1897.85s]  you know, sending to the factory like in Asia,
[1897.85s -> 1902.01s]  sending just like specs, you know, like tech packs, you know.
[1902.93s -> 1904.33s]  But we don't do like this.
[1904.33s -> 1907.89s]  We I mean, I go to like fabric fair,
[1907.89s -> 1912.45s]  like I handpick personally, like every every fabric
[1912.45s -> 1915.97s]  or I develop with factories, the fabrics.
[1917.01s -> 1922.49s]  You know, everything is like, yeah, I mean, it's it's it's
[1923.61s -> 1925.77s]  it's a it's a lot of it's a lot of work.
[1925.77s -> 1928.77s]  It's like everything is bespoke and
[1930.29s -> 1932.97s]  and it makes it makes different.
[1932.97s -> 1934.93s]  In the end, the product is different.
[1935.37s -> 1939.17s]  And I think this is what people are buying, you know,
[1939.17s -> 1941.57s]  you buy like a product, of course, and then, of course,
[1941.57s -> 1944.61s]  you buy like, you know, I always say that,
[1946.45s -> 1951.33s]  you know, and and we don't we don't buy,
[1952.41s -> 1954.37s]  you know, when you buy like you buy a brand,
[1954.37s -> 1956.73s]  like when you of course, the product is very important.
[1956.73s -> 1960.37s]  So but this for me is incompressible.
[1960.37s -> 1962.41s]  It's like the product is a product that will be
[1962.41s -> 1965.13s]  performance and great, of course.
[1965.77s -> 1970.77s]  Yeah. But then then you you you don't buy the product,
[1970.77s -> 1976.57s]  you know, you buy the the idea of who you can become
[1976.57s -> 1978.49s]  if you wear the product, you know.
[1978.49s -> 1980.73s]  Yes, it's aspirational.
[1980.73s -> 1984.09s]  Exactly. And so we sell an identity.
[1984.09s -> 1989.25s]  If you were satisfied, you you you you're part of,
[1990.25s -> 1995.49s]  you know, like a culture and what's the value for that?
[1995.49s -> 2001.81s]  You know, and and and and so, you know, you you you know,
[2001.81s -> 2005.65s]  there's many ways to understand and to and to see
[2005.65s -> 2008.13s]  like, you know, pricing.
[2010.61s -> 2015.01s]  But I truly believe that that, you know,
[2015.01s -> 2019.01s]  you know, what doesn't work is like a bad product
[2019.97s -> 2022.21s]  and expensive, which is also expensive.
[2022.21s -> 2023.17s]  This doesn't work.
[2023.17s -> 2025.33s]  But like if you have a really good product
[2025.33s -> 2028.45s]  and if it's expensive and if you feel great
[2029.09s -> 2030.77s]  about like owning this product,
[2030.77s -> 2032.45s]  not only because the product is great,
[2032.45s -> 2036.77s]  but because also you will be part of like something bigger.
[2037.33s -> 2040.37s]  Well, I think it's, you know, I mean, you know,
[2040.37s -> 2042.53s]  I'm, you know, me as a person,
[2042.53s -> 2045.25s]  I'm very happy to spend money on something
[2045.25s -> 2048.45s]  that I will know will support brands I like,
[2048.45s -> 2051.17s]  but also I will feel like part of something bigger.
[2051.17s -> 2053.97s]  And I think this has no value.
[2053.97s -> 2055.89s]  You know, I buy I buy a lot.
[2055.89s -> 2058.05s]  I'm obsessed with vintage, you know,
[2058.05s -> 2061.09s]  bands tea, you know, and, you know,
[2061.09s -> 2064.21s]  I can spend like $300 on the band tea and like,
[2064.21s -> 2065.81s]  yeah, it's just a cotton tea.
[2065.81s -> 2068.37s]  I know it's not, but you're not buying a cotton tea.
[2068.37s -> 2069.89s]  You're buying like an original,
[2069.89s -> 2073.81s]  like a black T-shirt, you know, it's a piece of,
[2074.69s -> 2076.13s]  it's a piece of like history.
[2076.13s -> 2079.33s]  It's like, yeah, it's just, it's culture, you know?
[2079.33s -> 2082.53s]  So yeah, that's, that's, that's, that's different.
[2083.17s -> 2086.45s]  So building, building brands to the way
[2086.45s -> 2088.69s]  that you're talking about can be expensive.
[2088.69s -> 2091.49s]  Building the products, let's, let's assume,
[2091.49s -> 2092.69s]  let's for the sake of conversation
[2092.69s -> 2095.57s]  that you sell out of everything you create.
[2095.57s -> 2099.01s]  You still have to have the money up front to make it.
[2099.65s -> 2101.33s]  And for payroll and all that sort of stuff.
[2101.97s -> 2104.05s]  And so with, with your obsession over the product
[2104.05s -> 2105.81s]  and wanting it to be great and you're,
[2105.81s -> 2107.57s]  you're on site, you're doing quality control.
[2107.57s -> 2109.01s]  You're making sure that nothing leaves.
[2109.65s -> 2111.89s]  Do you have a partner in this that's like,
[2111.89s -> 2114.61s]  hey, Brice, you know, can you bring it down a notch?
[2114.61s -> 2116.77s]  Because we've got to, you know, for,
[2116.77s -> 2119.09s]  for money purposes, we've got to do X, Y, Z.
[2119.09s -> 2120.21s]  Do you, do you have that?
[2120.21s -> 2122.37s]  Or, I mean, I also know that as an entrepreneur,
[2122.37s -> 2124.77s]  you can be, you can temper yourself as well
[2124.77s -> 2126.53s]  and handle that without a partner like that.
[2126.53s -> 2130.53s]  But have you been on running finances for the company
[2130.53s -> 2132.45s]  while running product and building a brand?
[2133.49s -> 2136.69s]  Yeah. I mean, I mean, you know, I'm, I'm a great leader.
[2136.69s -> 2138.13s]  I'm a terrible manager.
[2138.13s -> 2139.09s]  So like, hopefully.
[2139.09s -> 2139.59s]  Me too.
[2141.97s -> 2143.89s]  No fortunate. Yeah.
[2143.89s -> 2145.81s]  Fortunately, I have like, you know,
[2145.81s -> 2150.45s]  a team of people I can trust and, and the,
[2150.45s -> 2152.93s]  who helped me to navigate through like, you know,
[2152.93s -> 2154.61s]  as you just mentioned, you know,
[2156.85s -> 2161.01s]  all of these like, topics like finance and,
[2161.01s -> 2163.09s]  and, you know, cash flow management,
[2163.09s -> 2164.85s]  of course, like you need like, I mean,
[2164.85s -> 2167.09s]  you can do it on your own, like for a little while,
[2167.09s -> 2169.17s]  but then, you know, then, you know,
[2169.17s -> 2172.53s]  I want to focus on, so I'm the founder,
[2172.53s -> 2174.61s]  the CEO and the creative director.
[2174.61s -> 2176.53s]  But at some point, you know, you need to,
[2176.53s -> 2177.57s]  you need to pick.
[2177.57s -> 2182.85s]  And I, I, I think my value is mostly on the,
[2183.81s -> 2186.53s]  on the, you know, on the, on the creative side of things.
[2187.33s -> 2189.09s]  I have like a very precise,
[2189.09s -> 2192.45s]  like a strategic and business vision.
[2192.45s -> 2196.53s]  So once you have the vision, that's, you know,
[2196.53s -> 2198.45s]  you need to find the right people to,
[2199.17s -> 2202.61s]  that will like transform your vision into like a proper,
[2202.61s -> 2204.53s]  like a business and a sustainable business.
[2205.09s -> 2209.41s]  So it's all about the team, of course,
[2209.41s -> 2210.69s]  but like you need, of course,
[2211.57s -> 2217.25s]  the idea has to be, you know,
[2218.53s -> 2221.49s]  you need to have like a vision,
[2221.49s -> 2223.81s]  because so many brands have like great product,
[2223.81s -> 2226.13s]  but then it's very hard to also to,
[2226.13s -> 2227.89s]  to manage business because,
[2227.89s -> 2229.09s]  because it's not, again,
[2229.09s -> 2231.49s]  it's not only about the product,
[2231.49s -> 2236.21s]  it's about, you know, all the rest, too, you know?
[2236.21s -> 2236.93s]  So yeah.
[2237.97s -> 2239.41s]  One of the things that I love about
[2240.05s -> 2242.13s]  your branding is, I mean, sometimes I think,
[2244.21s -> 2247.73s]  because I'm, you know, my college degree was in branding,
[2247.73s -> 2249.17s]  not that college degrees mean much,
[2249.73s -> 2251.97s]  you know, but that's just what I have the emphasis on.
[2251.97s -> 2253.73s]  So much of what I've been building about Borderlands
[2253.73s -> 2255.57s]  is about the American West.
[2255.57s -> 2257.01s]  And so I'm over here on this side,
[2257.01s -> 2259.01s]  even though I'm not creating a tangible product,
[2259.01s -> 2260.45s]  I'm building community.
[2260.45s -> 2262.61s]  I'm looking at France to try and inform my,
[2262.61s -> 2264.21s]  my American West ideals.
[2264.21s -> 2266.45s]  You're in France and you have the, you know,
[2266.45s -> 2267.89s]  sounds like your whole life been influenced
[2267.89s -> 2268.69s]  by the American West.
[2269.41s -> 2272.05s]  But then there's this, the mix of punk rock
[2272.05s -> 2273.41s]  and skateboarding and all that.
[2273.41s -> 2277.01s]  And I think you as a, as a brand builder,
[2278.21s -> 2282.05s]  so clearly, I should say this before I go any further,
[2282.05s -> 2284.21s]  I was going to do something with Red Eyes
[2285.73s -> 2287.73s]  by The War on Drugs.
[2288.37s -> 2289.89s]  I was trying to get a license for it.
[2290.45s -> 2293.09s]  And then when you, your video, you know,
[2293.09s -> 2293.89s]  it's fantastic.
[2294.45s -> 2296.13s]  My video guy would have done a great job as well,
[2296.13s -> 2297.25s]  but I saw that and I was like, wow,
[2297.89s -> 2299.89s]  that song, I love that song.
[2299.89s -> 2304.85s]  And that is such a perfect embodiment of Americana,
[2304.85s -> 2306.29s]  but still good rock and roll.
[2306.29s -> 2307.81s]  It has some like, you know,
[2307.81s -> 2308.93s]  still has some punk rock stuff.
[2308.93s -> 2310.37s]  And then your video of that dude, right?
[2310.37s -> 2311.41s]  I mean, it was just,
[2311.41s -> 2313.41s]  so maybe I just wanted to say good job.
[2313.41s -> 2315.09s]  And I all, you were one step ahead
[2315.09s -> 2316.13s]  because I love that song.
[2317.09s -> 2317.65s]  Great video.
[2317.65s -> 2320.69s]  Yeah, I'm a huge War on Drugs fan, like, you know.
[2320.69s -> 2321.01s]  Yeah.
[2321.01s -> 2322.61s]  I'm going to, I'm going to follow them
[2322.61s -> 2326.61s]  on a few dates over the summer, like in UK.
[2327.57s -> 2327.89s]  Are you?
[2327.89s -> 2328.69s]  I'm obsessed.
[2328.69s -> 2330.21s]  I'm obsessed with this band, yes.
[2330.21s -> 2331.25s]  It's just, I don't know.
[2333.09s -> 2337.89s]  I mean, this video was, it's like,
[2339.01s -> 2341.33s]  it's like, if I think I built,
[2342.13s -> 2345.33s]  satisfy around the idea of this video, you know.
[2347.57s -> 2350.45s]  Like, like, you know, it has,
[2350.45s -> 2352.45s]  it has every single like, you know,
[2352.45s -> 2355.57s]  and, you know, like, I mean, first of all,
[2355.57s -> 2358.53s]  like Matt, like our athlete is amazing.
[2358.53s -> 2359.73s]  Like great runner.
[2359.73s -> 2360.45s]  Fast.
[2360.45s -> 2361.09s]  Yeah.
[2361.09s -> 2361.81s]  Yeah, fast.
[2364.45s -> 2365.49s]  And I don't know.
[2365.49s -> 2367.41s]  It's like, you know, California,
[2367.41s -> 2370.93s]  and he's running with like a cowboy shirt,
[2370.93s -> 2377.81s]  like, and with like this, like anachronistic.
[2377.81s -> 2380.37s]  I mean, War on Drugs are like so anachronistic.
[2380.37s -> 2381.33s]  It's like, you know, it's like,
[2381.73s -> 2384.53s]  you know, it's like, it's like Dire Straits,
[2384.53s -> 2386.05s]  Bruce Springsteen type of music.
[2386.85s -> 2388.29s]  It's like, that's rocks, you know.
[2388.29s -> 2389.41s]  And I love this.
[2389.41s -> 2393.09s]  So, and we did the video like horizontally,
[2393.09s -> 2394.29s]  you know, like, I mean, what the fuck.
[2394.29s -> 2395.01s]  I love that too.
[2395.73s -> 2398.37s]  It's just, and it's a five minute video, you know.
[2398.37s -> 2402.53s]  So it's like against every principle of like marketing
[2402.53s -> 2403.25s]  and whatever, you know.
[2403.25s -> 2404.77s]  But the content was great
[2404.77s -> 2409.89s]  and a lot of people connected with this video.
[2409.89s -> 2412.69s]  And again, you connect because of the music
[2412.69s -> 2416.85s]  or because of the runner or because of the style,
[2416.85s -> 2419.01s]  you know, there's always, I think, satisfied.
[2419.57s -> 2421.57s]  Sometimes people think that it's a bit like,
[2422.37s -> 2426.21s]  it's very difficult to get into us.
[2426.21s -> 2429.01s]  But I think that we always make sure
[2429.01s -> 2431.81s]  that people can get into the brand
[2431.81s -> 2435.73s]  through different doors, you know.
[2435.73s -> 2438.29s]  And it could be like the performance element
[2438.29s -> 2441.01s]  or the cultural element, you know,
[2441.01s -> 2443.09s]  or the place where we are sold.
[2443.09s -> 2445.41s]  You know, like there's always something
[2445.41s -> 2446.69s]  that you can connect.
[2446.69s -> 2448.69s]  And I think this is very, very important.
[2449.33s -> 2450.05s]  Yeah.
[2450.05s -> 2454.61s]  Do you put the same level of energy into,
[2454.61s -> 2455.73s]  you own a cafe, right?
[2455.73s -> 2456.69s]  Obladi Cafe.
[2457.49s -> 2457.99s]  Yeah.
[2458.53s -> 2462.29s]  I mean, are you branding that cafe
[2462.29s -> 2464.13s]  like you are branding Satisfy running?
[2464.85s -> 2466.37s]  Are you putting the same energy into that?
[2467.33s -> 2468.77s]  In the beginning, yes.
[2468.77s -> 2470.29s]  I have to say that today,
[2470.29s -> 2472.61s]  I mean, today there's like a manager
[2472.61s -> 2475.17s]  and it's like, it's rolling.
[2475.17s -> 2476.93s]  But like I wish I had more time
[2477.57s -> 2479.41s]  to focus a bit more on the coffee shop.
[2479.41s -> 2481.09s]  But the coffee shop is doing great.
[2481.09s -> 2482.53s]  I think they don't want me here.
[2482.53s -> 2485.25s]  But it's funny because I've launched
[2485.25s -> 2487.09s]  the coffee shop with two other friends.
[2487.89s -> 2490.45s]  The exact same day I've launched Satisfy.
[2492.37s -> 2494.85s]  So it was like in June 2015.
[2495.41s -> 2498.21s]  And but yeah, I mean, you know,
[2498.21s -> 2499.17s]  like everything I do,
[2499.17s -> 2501.17s]  I put like a lot of energy.
[2501.17s -> 2506.93s]  I'm very, I get obsessed quite easily.
[2506.93s -> 2509.01s]  Yeah, with everything, you know.
[2509.65s -> 2510.29s]  Yeah.
[2510.29s -> 2511.97s]  I love the, when I think about
[2511.97s -> 2513.33s]  the magazine that you put out,
[2514.85s -> 2517.65s]  it reminds me of, you know,
[2517.65s -> 2519.57s]  my punk rock days in America,
[2519.57s -> 2521.09s]  we would have called them zines,
[2521.09s -> 2522.93s]  like Z-I-N-E, zines,
[2522.93s -> 2523.73s]  where you're just kind of like
[2523.73s -> 2524.21s]  putting it together.
[2524.21s -> 2525.41s]  Do you have those in France?
[2526.61s -> 2529.97s]  Yeah, I was writing for fanzines
[2530.69s -> 2532.05s]  when I was younger.
[2532.05s -> 2535.49s]  And I was ordering from the U.S.
[2535.49s -> 2537.25s]  I was ordering also like
[2537.97s -> 2540.85s]  heart attack and ebullition fanzines,
[2540.85s -> 2542.29s]  like hardcore and punk stuff
[2543.89s -> 2546.05s]  from the U.S.
[2546.53s -> 2548.53s]  So like maximum rock and roll
[2548.53s -> 2549.25s]  and stuff like this.
[2549.25s -> 2550.77s]  So yeah, I mean, I grew up with fanzines.
[2550.77s -> 2551.33s]  I haven't thought about
[2551.33s -> 2552.93s]  maximum rock and roll in forever.
[2552.93s -> 2555.09s]  Yeah, that's a good comparison.
[2556.53s -> 2557.89s]  So what do you think is,
[2558.61s -> 2559.97s]  what's next for Satisfy?
[2561.09s -> 2561.89s]  Where do you want to be?
[2562.53s -> 2563.73s]  Are you taking it just one thing
[2563.73s -> 2564.77s]  at a time or are you like,
[2564.77s -> 2565.65s]  when you're a visionary,
[2565.65s -> 2566.69s]  are you thinking five years
[2566.69s -> 2567.89s]  down the road, ten years down the road?
[2569.33s -> 2574.29s]  Oh, we need to think five years ahead.
[2574.29s -> 2574.79s]  Yeah.
[2575.89s -> 2578.05s]  That's important because in this industry,
[2578.05s -> 2579.09s]  you know, product we do,
[2579.09s -> 2580.53s]  like it takes so much time
[2581.49s -> 2582.13s]  to develop.
[2584.05s -> 2586.45s]  So we are constantly thinking
[2586.45s -> 2587.81s]  about like what's next.
[2589.89s -> 2591.41s]  Near future, we are launching
[2591.41s -> 2592.93s]  the women's collection.
[2593.97s -> 2594.47s]  Oh, wow.
[2595.49s -> 2598.21s]  So yeah, that's, I mean,
[2598.21s -> 2599.09s]  so far we've been,
[2603.01s -> 2605.17s]  we never really like advertised it
[2605.17s -> 2607.49s]  as a menswear collection
[2607.49s -> 2608.53s]  or like, you know,
[2608.61s -> 2610.53s]  menswear driven or menswear,
[2610.53s -> 2613.97s]  not driven, sorry, menswear focused product
[2613.97s -> 2616.45s]  because the product is quite
[2616.45s -> 2617.89s]  like a gender fluid.
[2617.89s -> 2619.09s]  But of course, when it comes
[2619.09s -> 2619.81s]  to like, you know,
[2619.81s -> 2621.01s]  half tights, tights,
[2621.01s -> 2623.25s]  like sports bras and stuff,
[2623.25s -> 2627.41s]  you want products specifically made
[2627.41s -> 2632.29s]  for the female bodies.
[2633.17s -> 2635.41s]  So we are working on that.
[2638.77s -> 2640.69s]  Retail store opening,
[2640.69s -> 2643.33s]  that's something or so we want to,
[2644.77s -> 2647.17s]  you want to have your own like flagship.
[2649.25s -> 2649.73s]  Yeah.
[2649.73s -> 2654.44s]  In Paris specifically or who knows?
[2654.44s -> 2656.44s]  Paris, but also in the U.S.
[2656.44s -> 2657.24s]  Yeah, very cool.
[2658.76s -> 2660.52s]  And yeah, so we have this
[2661.40s -> 2662.28s]  growing the team
[2662.28s -> 2663.96s]  because of course, you know,
[2663.96s -> 2666.68s]  we are 25 people now.
[2666.68s -> 2667.18s]  Oh, goodness.
[2668.14s -> 2670.62s]  But we, you know, we will be,
[2671.90s -> 2674.46s]  we will be certainly bigger
[2674.46s -> 2675.90s]  next year.
[2676.46s -> 2679.18s]  So yeah, the brand is growing
[2679.18s -> 2684.14s]  and that's very interesting.
[2684.14s -> 2686.06s]  Like, I like the idea of like
[2686.94s -> 2690.14s]  building satisfy as, you know,
[2692.30s -> 2693.58s]  we want to be part of the,
[2693.58s -> 2695.26s]  you know, we want to be
[2697.74s -> 2699.18s]  when I say like big brand,
[2699.18s -> 2700.62s]  it's not about like the revenue
[2700.62s -> 2701.42s]  or, you know, it's just,
[2701.98s -> 2703.10s]  we want to be relevant
[2703.10s -> 2705.34s]  for the culture.
[2705.34s -> 2710.62s]  And we also want influential
[2710.62s -> 2712.38s]  and we also want like,
[2712.38s -> 2713.90s]  you know, people to run more,
[2713.90s -> 2715.42s]  more people to run.
[2716.14s -> 2717.74s]  You know, when we receive messages
[2717.74s -> 2719.26s]  like on Instagram,
[2719.26s -> 2720.86s]  like, oh, I was not a runner,
[2720.86s -> 2722.62s]  but then I discovered satisfy
[2722.62s -> 2725.02s]  and it made me want to start to run.
[2725.02s -> 2725.74s]  That's amazing.
[2725.74s -> 2729.58s]  That's the best thing you can hear.
[2730.46s -> 2731.82s]  Yeah, yeah, that's great.
[2731.82s -> 2734.86s]  So I think, I hope we can inspire
[2734.86s -> 2735.74s]  like more and more,
[2735.74s -> 2736.70s]  like people to run,
[2737.66s -> 2739.58s]  especially more people,
[2739.58s -> 2741.10s]  like, you know, from the cities,
[2741.10s -> 2741.98s]  leaving the city
[2741.98s -> 2743.58s]  and experiencing the trades.
[2743.58s -> 2745.74s]  And I think that's, yeah,
[2745.74s -> 2748.70s]  I think that's one of the,
[2748.70s -> 2750.38s]  one of the goals of satisfy.
[2750.38s -> 2753.02s]  And we've been also exploring
[2753.02s -> 2754.94s]  some other categories
[2755.02s -> 2756.94s]  like, like climbing.
[2757.98s -> 2758.62s]  Oh, interesting.
[2759.02s -> 2761.42s]  We, yeah, I mean,
[2761.42s -> 2763.02s]  Michael Versey, for example,
[2763.02s -> 2764.70s]  he's was a climber
[2764.70s -> 2766.22s]  before being like a runner.
[2766.86s -> 2769.34s]  And, you know, like
[2769.34s -> 2771.50s]  there is this like a connection
[2771.50s -> 2773.82s]  between trail runners and climbers.
[2776.06s -> 2779.50s]  And so we've been doing
[2779.50s -> 2781.18s]  a few like climbing products.
[2781.74s -> 2785.02s]  We want to keep trail running
[2785.02s -> 2787.10s]  as our core.
[2788.14s -> 2791.50s]  But, you know, being able to explore
[2791.50s -> 2795.18s]  like, you know, activities
[2795.18s -> 2797.18s]  around like trail running
[2797.18s -> 2799.66s]  is very, you know,
[2799.66s -> 2802.38s]  could be also like something
[2802.38s -> 2803.66s]  we do more and more
[2803.66s -> 2804.78s]  in the next few years.
[2805.58s -> 2806.46s]  As an entrepreneur,
[2806.46s -> 2809.90s]  does that expanding satisfy
[2809.90s -> 2811.34s]  into other categories, scratch
[2811.34s -> 2812.62s]  your entrepreneurial itch
[2812.62s -> 2813.90s]  or do you still have a mind
[2813.90s -> 2815.34s]  that's really hard to quiet
[2815.34s -> 2816.54s]  and you can't stop thinking
[2816.54s -> 2818.30s]  about other things
[2818.30s -> 2818.94s]  because you've been doing
[2818.94s -> 2819.82s]  satisfy for a long time.
[2819.82s -> 2821.18s]  It's a long time for an entrepreneur
[2821.18s -> 2822.06s]  or the way that you are.
[2823.02s -> 2823.50s]  Does your,
[2823.50s -> 2825.10s]  is your imagination always kind of still,
[2825.90s -> 2828.38s]  you know, going back to skateboarding,
[2828.38s -> 2829.66s]  you know, or going into other industries
[2829.66s -> 2832.14s]  or is satisfy satisfying
[2832.14s -> 2834.94s]  your brain's ambition right now?
[2836.06s -> 2836.38s]  Yes.
[2836.38s -> 2839.10s]  But also I think I try to build a brand
[2839.10s -> 2840.62s]  that, you know, if I, you know,
[2841.18s -> 2843.18s]  when I will be, you know,
[2843.18s -> 2844.78s]  when I will be dead, I think,
[2844.78s -> 2846.30s]  and I hope that, you know,
[2846.30s -> 2849.66s]  some people will be taking over satisfy
[2849.66s -> 2851.34s]  and I hope satisfy will like,
[2852.38s -> 2853.98s]  you know, will be like
[2853.98s -> 2857.02s]  a transgenerational brand.
[2857.02s -> 2859.66s]  That's the idea, you know.
[2859.66s -> 2862.70s]  I'm not here for the one shot, you know.
[2862.70s -> 2864.54s]  So I want to make sure
[2864.54s -> 2867.42s]  that, you know, that the brand
[2867.42s -> 2869.18s]  is like a strong and solid enough
[2870.54s -> 2871.90s]  to live on.
[2872.78s -> 2873.28s]  Yeah.
[2874.14s -> 2875.42s]  Well, Brice, I know that you need
[2875.42s -> 2876.70s]  to go see Judas Priest.
[2878.86s -> 2882.22s]  But I really appreciate your time
[2882.22s -> 2884.06s]  and getting to hear about satisfy.
[2884.06s -> 2884.94s]  I hope when we're in,
[2884.94s -> 2886.70s]  when our family gets to France
[2886.70s -> 2888.86s]  in September that we can hang out
[2888.86s -> 2891.10s]  and I'll meet you at Obladi Cafe
[2891.10s -> 2893.18s]  and grab a coffee or something
[2893.18s -> 2894.30s]  and catch up.
[2894.30s -> 2895.58s]  But I'm just thankful
[2895.58s -> 2896.38s]  that you'd even give me
[2896.38s -> 2897.90s]  this hour of your time today
[2897.90s -> 2899.58s]  and to share the story of satisfy
[2899.58s -> 2900.62s]  and who you are.
[2900.62s -> 2901.18s]  So thank you.
[2902.14s -> 2903.50s]  No, thank you, Joshua.
[2903.50s -> 2904.46s]  It was a real pleasure
[2904.46s -> 2907.34s]  to be part of Borderlands.
[2908.38s -> 2910.06s]  I will be in Arizona, I think,
[2910.86s -> 2912.94s]  for Cocodona 250.
[2912.94s -> 2913.44s]  Oh, you will?
[2913.44s -> 2914.70s]  So I don't know if you're,
[2914.70s -> 2916.30s]  yes, you know, every year we have,
[2916.30s -> 2917.02s]  I mean, every year,
[2917.02s -> 2919.02s]  it will be the second year
[2919.02s -> 2921.74s]  we have the Satisfy Aid Station
[2921.74s -> 2922.94s]  at Cocodona.
[2922.94s -> 2924.46s]  Do you have anything to do with FLOTA?
[2924.46s -> 2925.26s]  Is FLOTA you?
[2926.06s -> 2929.82s]  Yeah, FLOTA started as a collaboration
[2929.82s -> 2932.06s]  between us and Outside Magazine.
[2933.90s -> 2939.58s]  But yeah, we created FLOTA with Outside
[2939.58s -> 2943.26s]  and yeah, it's a good product too.
[2944.06s -> 2946.22s]  I've got a handful of people
[2946.22s -> 2948.30s]  that I'm invested in,
[2948.30s -> 2949.74s]  not financially, just emotionally,
[2949.74s -> 2951.02s]  that are running Cocodona
[2951.02s -> 2951.82s]  that I want to go see.
[2951.82s -> 2953.42s]  So maybe I'll see if I can come down.
[2953.42s -> 2954.78s]  If so, I'll let you know and say,
[2954.78s -> 2956.22s]  hey, but either way, I love that race
[2956.22s -> 2957.34s]  and I love seeing you,
[2957.34s -> 2958.70s]  you know, satisfied being a part of it.
[2959.34s -> 2961.42s]  Yeah, and Michael Versteeg
[2961.42s -> 2963.66s]  will be running it actually.
[2963.66s -> 2965.34s]  Yeah, it sounds like he's really
[2965.34s -> 2966.70s]  like focused on it
[2966.70s -> 2968.46s]  and wanting compared to previous years
[2968.46s -> 2969.58s]  where he just kind of shows up
[2969.58s -> 2971.10s]  and he won it, you know,
[2971.10s -> 2972.06s]  that year, year one.
[2972.06s -> 2974.46s]  But it's going to be a competitive field
[2974.46s -> 2974.70s]  this year.
[2974.70s -> 2975.58s]  It's going to be a fun race.
[2976.46s -> 2978.70s]  Yeah, so much can happen
[2978.70s -> 2979.50s]  on this distance.
[2979.50s -> 2980.54s]  It's crazy.
[2980.54s -> 2981.34s]  Yeah, all right.
[2981.34s -> 2982.38s]  Maybe I'll see at the starting line
[2982.38s -> 2983.34s]  if I can figure out a way down there.
[2983.34s -> 2984.94s]  Yeah, great.
[2984.94s -> 2987.34s]  Thanks, Josh.
